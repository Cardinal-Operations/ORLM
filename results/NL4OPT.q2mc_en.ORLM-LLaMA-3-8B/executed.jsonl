The following is the formulation of the model:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of scooters produced per month.\n- \\(y\\): Number of bikes produced per month.\n\nThese variables represent the quantities of each product produced per month to meet customer demand.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize total profit: \\(Z = 200x + 300y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total profit based on the quantities of each product produced and their respective profits.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Design team time constraint: \\(2x + 4y \\leq 5000\\)\n   - This ensures that the total time allocated to the design team for scooter and bike production does not exceed the available 5000 hours per month.\n2. Engineering team time constraint: \\(3x + 5y \\leq 6000\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limitation on the time allocated to the engineering team for scooter and bike production, ensuring it does not exceed the available 6000 hours per month.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the quantities of products cannot be negative or fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal quantities of each product to produce, maximizing total profit while satisfying the time constraints of the design and engineering teams. This will provide the company with the most economically efficient production strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ProductMixOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Scooters\")\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Bikes\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(200 * x + 300 * y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2 * x + 4 * y <= 5000, name=\"DesignTeamConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(3 * x + 5 * y <= 6000, name=\"EngineeringTeamConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized profit: ${}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of scooters produced: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of bikes produced: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first import the `coptpy` library and create a COPT environment and model.\n\n2. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of scooters and bikes produced per month, respectively. These variables are defined as integer types.\n\n3. Next, we set the objective function, which is to maximize total profit. The objective function is `200 * x + 300 * y`, where 200 and 300 are the profits per scooter and bike, respectively.\n\n4. Then, we add two constraints:\n   - Design team time constraint: `2 * x + 4 * y <= 5000`, ensuring that the total time allocated to the design team for scooter and bike production does not exceed the available 5000 hours per month.\n   - Engineering team time constraint: `3 * x + 5 * y <= 6000`, ensuring that the total time allocated to the engineering team for scooter and bike production does not exceed the available 6000 hours per month.\n\n5. We call the `model.solve()` method to solve the model.\n\n6. Finally, we check the model's solution status. If the status is `COPT.OPTIMAL`, indicating an optimal solution is found, we output the maximized profit and the optimal quantities of scooters and bikes produced. If no optimal solution is found, we output the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the product mix optimization problem using the `coptpy` library, maximizing profit while satisfying the time constraints of the design and engineering teams.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ProductMixOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Scooters\")\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Bikes\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(200 * x + 300 * y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2 * x + 4 * y <= 5000, name=\"DesignTeamConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(3 * x + 5 * y <= 6000, name=\"EngineeringTeamConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized profit: ${}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of scooters produced: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of bikes produced: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Vehicle type ratio constraint: \\(x \\leq 0.3(y + x)\\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y\\) must be integers, as the number of vehicles cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of vans and cars to minimize the total number of cars used while ensuring that all voters are transported to the polls and complying with the vehicle type ratio constraint. This will provide the volunteer organization with an economically efficient vehicle allocation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"VehicleAllocation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of vans\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of cars\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of cars used\nmodel.setObjective(y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(6*x + 3*y >= 200, name=\"VoterTransportation\")  # Ensure all voters are transported to the polls\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 0.3*(x + y), name=\"VehicleTypeRatio\")  # Vehicle type ratio constraint\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum number of cars used: {}\".format(int(y.x)))\n    print(\"Number of vans: {}\".format(int(x.x)))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of vans and cars, respectively. The objective function is set to minimize the total number of cars used, which is `y`.\n\nWe add two constraints:\n1. `6*x + 3*y >= 200` ensures that all voters are transported to the polls.\n2. `x <= 0.3*(x + y)` represents the vehicle type ratio constraint, where at most 30% of the vehicles can be vans.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results. If an optimal solution is found, we print the minimum number of cars used and the number of vans. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no optimal solution was found.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the vehicle allocation problem for the volunteer organization, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"VehicleAllocation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of vans\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of cars\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of cars used\nmodel.setObjective(y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(6*x + 3*y >= 200, name=\"VoterTransportation\")  # Ensure all voters are transported to the polls\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 0.3*(x + y), name=\"VehicleTypeRatio\")  # Vehicle type ratio constraint\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum number of cars used: {}\".format(int(y.x)))\n    print(\"Number of vans: {}\".format(int(x.x)))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The following is the formulation of the model:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of square feet of hardwood flooring produced weekly.\n- \\(y\\): Number of square feet of vinyl planks produced weekly.\n\nThese variables represent the quantities of each type of flooring produced weekly to meet the demand.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize profit: \\(Z = 2.5x + 3y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total profit based on the quantities of each type of flooring produced and their respective profits.\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

Labor shortage for vinyl planks: \\(y \\leq 30000\\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\), as the production quantities of flooring cannot be negative.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal quantities of each type of flooring to be produced weekly, maximizing the company's profit while satisfying the demand and adhering to the production constraints. This will provide the flooring company with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its production resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the flooring company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the flooring company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"FlooringCompanyOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x\")  # Hardwood flooring (square feet)\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"y\")  # Vinyl planks (square feet)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 20000, name=\"HardwoodDemand\")  # Demand for hardwood flooring\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 10000, name=\"VinylDemand\")  # Demand for vinyl planks\nmodel.addConstr(x + y >= 60000, name=\"ShippingContract\")  # Shipping contract\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 50000, name=\"HardwoodLaborShortage\")  # Labor shortage for hardwood flooring\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 30000, name=\"VinylLaborShortage\")  # Labor shortage for vinyl planks\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize profit\nmodel.setObjective(2.5*x + 3*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized profit: ${model.objval:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production quantities: Hardwood flooring = {x.x:.2f} square feet, Vinyl planks = {y.x:.2f} square feet\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"FlooringCompanyOptimization\" for the flooring company problem.\n3.

Adds five constraint conditions corresponding to the demand for hardwood flooring, demand for vinyl planks, shipping contract, and labor shortage for hardwood flooring and vinyl planks.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize profit, with a profit of $2.5 per square foot for hardwood flooring and $3 per square foot for vinyl planks.\n6. Solves the model.\n7.

Non-negativity constraints on the number of minutes used for each beam: \\[x_1, x_2 \\geq 0\\]\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of minutes to use for each beam, minimizing the total radiation received by the pancreas while satisfying the constraints of radiation dosage to the skin and tumor. This will provide the patient with an optimized radiation treatment plan.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"RadiationTherapyOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x1\")  # Number of minutes of Beam 1 used\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x2\")  # Number of minutes of Beam 2 used\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(0.2*x1 + 0.1*x2 <= 4, name=\"SkinConstraint\")  # At most 4 units of medicine should be received by the skin\nmodel.addConstr(0.6*x1 + 0.4*x2 >= 3, name=\"TumorConstraint\")  # At least 3 units of medicine should be delivered to the tumor\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total radiation received by the pancreas\nmodel.setObjective(0.3*x1 + 0.2*x2, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total radiation received by the pancreas: {:.2f} units of medicine\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of minutes of Beam 1 used: {:.2f} minutes\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of minutes of Beam 2 used: {:.2f} minutes\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of minutes of Beam 1 and Beam 2 used, respectively. Next, we add two constraints to ensure that the radiation dosage to the skin and tumor is within the specified range. The objective function is set to minimize the total radiation received by the pancreas. Finally, we solve the model and output the results, including the minimum total radiation received by the pancreas and the optimal number of minutes used for each beam.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem of radiation treatment, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"RadiationTherapyOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x1\")  # Number of minutes of Beam 1 used\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x2\")  # Number of minutes of Beam 2 used\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(0.2*x1 + 0.1*x2 <= 4, name=\"SkinConstraint\")  # At most 4 units of medicine should be received by the skin\nmodel.addConstr(0.6*x1 + 0.4*x2 >= 3, name=\"TumorConstraint\")  # At least 3 units of medicine should be delivered to the tumor\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total radiation received by the pancreas\nmodel.setObjective(0.3*x1 + 0.2*x2, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total radiation received by the pancreas: {:.2f} units of medicine\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of minutes of Beam 1 used: {:.2f} minutes\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of minutes of Beam 2 used: {:.2f} minutes\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

If the village needs to transport at least 500 people, how many of each vehicle should be used to minimize the total number of bikes needed?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the transportation problem for the village banquet, we need to construct a linear programming model to minimize the total number of bikes needed while satisfying the transportation requirements and the proportion constraint of vehicle types. Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of bikes used.\n- \\(y\\): Number of cars used.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of bikes needed: \\(Z = x\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Transportation demand constraint: \\(3x + 5y \\geq 500\\)\n   - This ensures that the total number of people transported by bikes and cars is at least 500.\n2. Car proportion constraint: \\(y \\leq 0.4(x + y)\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of cars does not exceed 40% of the total number of vehicles.\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of bikes and cars to minimize the total number of bikes needed while satisfying the transportation requirements and the proportion constraint of vehicle types. This will provide the village with an economically efficient transportation plan.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"VillageTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of bikes\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of cars\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y >= 500, name=\"DemandConstraint\")  # Transportation demand constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 0.4*(x + y), name=\"CarRatioConstraint\")  # Car proportion constraint\n\n# Set the objective function: Minimize the total number of bikes needed\nmodel.setObjective(x, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total number of bikes needed: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of bikes: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of cars: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model.

Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"SouvenirShopOptimization\" for the souvenir shop problem.\n3. Adds two decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the quantities of wooden elephants and tigers to be made. These variables are defined as non-negative integers.\n4. Adds two constraints:\n   - Wood usage constraint: Ensures that the total amount of wood used for making the products does not exceed the available 5000 grams of wood per week.\n   - Plastic usage constraint: Ensures that the total amount of plastic used for making the products does not exceed the available 4000 grams of plastic per week.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize total profit, which is calculated as the profit per elephant multiplied by the quantity of elephants, plus the profit per tiger multiplied by the quantity of tigers.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the maximized total profit and the optimal production quantities.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a concise method to solve the optimization problem for the souvenir shop using the `coptpy` library, considering the constraints of wood and plastic usage and the objective of maximizing profit.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the souvenir shop problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SouvenirShopOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of wooden elephants\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of wooden tigers\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(50*x + 40*y <= 5000, name=\"WoodConstraint\")  # Wood usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 30*y <= 4000, name=\"PlasticConstraint\")  # Plastic usage constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(5*x + 4*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production quantities: Wooden Elephants = {x.x}, Wooden Tigers = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:53 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Number of vans constraint: \\( x \\geq y \\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\( x, y \\geq 0 \\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of vans and minibuses to use, minimizing the total amount of pollution produced while satisfying the constraints of the number of children and the number of vehicles. This will provide an environmentally friendly solution for how children go to school.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SchoolTransportationOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of vans\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of minibuses\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total pollution\nmodel.setObjective(7 * x + 10 * y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(6 * x + 10 * y >= 150, name=\"StudentConstraint\")  # Number of children constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 10, name=\"BusConstraint\")  # Number of minibuses constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= y, name=\"VanConstraint\")  # Number of vans constraint\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total pollution: {:.2f} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of vans used: {:.0f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of minibuses used: {:.0f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of vans and minibuses used, respectively. The objective function is to minimize the total pollution, which is `7 * x + 10 * y`.\n\nWe add three constraints:\n1. Number of children constraint: `6 * x + 10 * y >= 150`\n2. Number of minibuses constraint: `y <= 10`\n3. Number of vans constraint: `x >= y`\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the minimum total pollution and the number of vans and minibuses used.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem of how children go to school, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SchoolTransportationOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of vans\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of minibuses\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total pollution\nmodel.setObjective(7 * x + 10 * y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(6 * x + 10 * y >= 150, name=\"StudentConstraint\")  # Number of children constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 10, name=\"BusConstraint\")  # Number of minibuses constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= y, name=\"VanConstraint\")  # Number of vans constraint\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total pollution: {:.2f} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of vans used: {:.0f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of minibuses used: {:.0f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1\\): Number of times the process with a catalyst is used.\n- \\(x_2\\): Number of times the process without a catalyst is used.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced: \\(Z = 15x_1 + 18x_2\\)\n  - This function calculates the total amount of carbon dioxide produced based on the amount of carbon dioxide produced by each process and the number of times each process is used.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Wood supply constraint: \\(10x_1 + 15x_2 \\leq 300\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the total amount of wood used does not exceed the available wood.\n2. Oxygen supply constraint: \\(20x_1 + 12x_2 \\leq 300\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the total amount of oxygen used does not exceed the available oxygen.\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2 \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of times each process is used must be an integer.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of times each process should be used to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced while satisfying the constraints of wood and oxygen supply. This will provide an optimal production strategy for the carbon dioxide production process.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CO2Production\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of times the process with a catalyst is used\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of times the process without a catalyst is used\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced\nmodel.setObjective(15*x1 + 18*x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Wood supply constraint\nmodel.addConstr(10*x1 + 15*x2 <= 300, name=\"WoodSupply\")\n\n# Oxygen supply constraint\nmodel.addConstr(20*x1 + 12*x2 <= 300, name=\"OxygenSupply\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized amount of carbon dioxide produced: {} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of times the process with a catalyst is used: {} times\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of times the process without a catalyst is used: {} times\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first import the `coptpy` library and create a COPT environment and model.\n\n2. Then, we add two decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of times the process with a catalyst and the process without a catalyst are used, respectively. These variables are defined as integer variables.\n\n3. Next, we set the objective function, which is to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced. The objective function is `15*x1 + 18*x2`, where 15 and 18 represent the amount of carbon dioxide produced by each process.\n\n4. Then, we add two constraints:\n   - Wood supply constraint: `10*x1 + 15*x2 <= 300`, which ensures that the total amount of wood used does not exceed the available wood (300 units).\n   - Oxygen supply constraint: `20*x1 + 12*x2 <= 300`, which ensures that the total amount of oxygen used does not exceed the available oxygen (300 units).\n\n5. Finally, we solve the model and output the results. If an optimal solution is found, we output the maximized amount of carbon dioxide produced and the number of times each process is used. If no optimal solution is found, we output the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve this linear programming problem using the `coptpy` library, finding the optimal number of times each process should be used to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced while satisfying the constraints of wood and oxygen supply.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CO2Production\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of times the process with a catalyst is used\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of times the process without a catalyst is used\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced\nmodel.setObjective(15*x1 + 18*x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Wood supply constraint\nmodel.addConstr(10*x1 + 15*x2 <= 300, name=\"WoodSupply\")\n\n# Oxygen supply constraint\nmodel.addConstr(20*x1 + 12*x2 <= 300, name=\"OxygenSupply\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized amount of carbon dioxide produced: {} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of times the process with a catalyst is used: {} times\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of times the process without a catalyst is used: {} times\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide a strategy for formulating the shampoo that minimizes the total amount of time it takes for the mixture to be effective.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ShampooFormulation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Sulfate\")\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Ginger\")\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 100, name=\"MinSulfate\")\nmodel.addConstr(x + y == 400, name=\"TotalIngredients\")\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 2*y, name=\"SulfateGingerRatio\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(0.5*x + 0.75*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total time for the mixture to be effective: {:.2f} minutes\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of units of sulfate to be added: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of units of ginger to be added: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first import the `coptpy` library and create a COPT environment and model.\n\n2. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of units of sulfate and ginger to be added, respectively. These variables are defined as non-negative integers.\n\n3. Next, we add three constraints:\n   - The shampoo must contain at least 100 units of sulfates.\n   - The shampoo must contain a total of 400 units of both ingredient.\n   - There can be at most twice the amount of sulfate as ginger in the shampoo.\n\n4. We set the objective function, which is to minimize the total amount of time it takes for the mixture to be effective (0.5x + 0.75y).\n\n5. We call the `model.solve()` method to solve the model.\n\n6. Finally, we check the solution status of the model. If an optimal solution is found, we output the minimum total time for the mixture to be effective, as well as the optimal number of units of sulfate and ginger to be added. If no optimal solution is found, we output the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve this linear programming problem using the `coptpy` library, finding the optimal formulation of the shampoo that minimizes the total amount of time it takes for the mixture to be effective while satisfying the constraints on the amounts of ingredients.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ShampooFormulation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Sulfate\")\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"Ginger\")\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 100, name=\"MinSulfate\")\nmodel.addConstr(x + y == 400, name=\"TotalIngredients\")\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 2*y, name=\"SulfateGingerRatio\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(0.5*x + 0.75*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total time for the mixture to be effective: {:.2f} minutes\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of units of sulfate to be added: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of units of ginger to be added: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of servings of almonds to eat.\n- \\(y\\): Number of servings of cashews to eat.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize fat intake: \\(Z = 15x + 12y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total fat intake based on the number of servings of almonds and cashews eaten and their respective fat content.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Calorie intake requirement: \\(200x + 300y \\geq 10000\\)\n   - This ensures that the total calorie intake from almonds and cashews is at least 10000 calories.\n2. Protein intake requirement: \\(20x + 25y \\geq 800\\)\n   - This ensures that the total protein intake from almonds and cashews is at least 800 grams.\n3. Almond-to-cashew ratio requirement: \\(x \\geq 2y\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of servings of almonds eaten is at least twice the number of servings of cashews.\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\), as the number of servings cannot be negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of servings of almonds and cashews to eat, minimizing fat intake while meeting the calorie and protein intake requirements. This will provide the woman with an optimal diet plan.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"DietOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of servings of almonds\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of servings of cashews\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(200*x + 300*y >= 10000, name=\"CalorieRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 25*y >= 800, name=\"ProteinRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 2*y, name=\"NutRatioRequirement\")\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize fat intake\nmodel.setObjective(15*x + 12*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum fat intake: {:.2f} grams\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal number of servings of almonds: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Optimal number of servings of cashews: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of servings of almonds and cashews to eat.\n\nNext, we add three constraints:\n1. Calorie intake requirement: Ensures that the total calorie intake from almonds and cashews is at least 10000 calories.\n2. Protein intake requirement: Ensures that the total protein intake from almonds and cashews is at least 800 grams.\n3. Almond-to-cashew ratio requirement: Ensures that the number of servings of almonds eaten is at least twice the number of servings of cashews.\n\nThen, we set the objective function to minimize fat intake, which is `15*x + 12*y`.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and analyze the solution. If an optimal solution is found, we output the minimum fat intake and the optimal number of servings of almonds and cashews. If no optimal solution is found, we output the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the woman's diet problem, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"DietOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of servings of almonds\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of servings of cashews\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(200*x + 300*y >= 10000, name=\"CalorieRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 25*y >= 800, name=\"ProteinRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 2*y, name=\"NutRatioRequirement\")\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize fat intake\nmodel.setObjective(15*x + 12*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum fat intake: {:.2f} grams\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal number of servings of almonds: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Optimal number of servings of cashews: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Minimum production requirement for each type of ice cream: \\(x \\geq 5, y \\geq 5\\)\n   - This ensures that at least 5 gallons of each type of ice cream are produced to meet the minimum demand.\n2. Maximum production limit for chocolate ice cream: \\(x \\leq 10\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the maximum production limit of 10 gallons for chocolate ice cream.\n3.

Total number of chicken transported: \\(100x + 40y \\geq 1200\\)\n   - This ensures that the total number of chicken transported is at least 1200.\n2. Limit on the number of bus trips: \\(x \\leq 10\\)\n   - This limits the number of bus trips to a maximum of 10.\n3. Proportion of car trips: \\(y \\geq 0.6(x + y)\\)\n   - This ensures that at least 60% of the trips are by car.\n4. Non-negativity constraints:\n   - \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y\\) must be integers, as the number of trips cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of bus and car trips to minimize the total time required to transport the chicken while satisfying the constraints of the number of trips and the proportion of car trips. This will provide the chicken farmer with an economically efficient transportation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the chicken farmer's transportation problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the chicken farmer's transportation problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ChickenTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of bus trips\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of car trips\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(100*x + 40*y >= 1200, name=\"TotalChickenConstraint\")  # Total number of chicken transported\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 10, name=\"BusTripLimitConstraint\")  # Limit on the number of bus trips\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 0.6*(x + y), name=\"CarTripProportionConstraint\")  # Proportion of car trips\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total time\nmodel.setObjective(2*x + 1.5*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total time: {model.objval} hours\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of trips: Bus = {x.x}, Car = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of bus and car trips, respectively.\n\nNext, we add three constraints:\n1. `TotalChickenConstraint` ensures that the total number of chicken transported is at least 1200.\n2. `BusTripLimitConstraint` limits the number of bus trips to a maximum of 10.\n3. `CarTripProportionConstraint` ensures that at least 60% of the trips are by car.\n\nThen, we set the objective function to minimize the total time, which is `2*x + 1.5*y`.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and analyze the solution. If an optimal solution is found, we print the minimum total time and the optimal number of trips. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no optimal solution was found.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the chicken farmer's transportation problem, including creating the model, adding variables and constraints, setting the objective function, and analyzing the solution.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the chicken farmer's transportation problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ChickenTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of bus trips\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of car trips\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(100*x + 40*y >= 1200, name=\"TotalChickenConstraint\")  # Total number of chicken transported\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 10, name=\"BusTripLimitConstraint\")  # Limit on the number of bus trips\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 0.6*(x + y), name=\"CarTripProportionConstraint\")  # Proportion of car trips\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total time\nmodel.setObjective(2*x + 1.5*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total time: {model.objval} hours\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of trips: Bus = {x.x}, Car = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of units of coconut oil and lavender to be added, respectively.\n\nNext, we add four constraints:\n1. Constraint on the amount of coconut oil, which must be greater than or equal to 300 and less than or equal to 550.\n2. Constraint on the ratio of coconut oil to lavender, which must be less than or equal to 3.\n3. Constraint on the total amount of coconut oil and lavender, which must be greater than or equal to 300.\n4. Constraint on the total amount of coconut oil and lavender, which must be less than or equal to 3 times the amount of coconut oil.\n\nThen, we set the objective function to minimize the total amount of time it takes for the mixture to be effective, which is `0.7*x + 0.9*y`.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results.

The formulation of the model is as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of containers of Oil Max to produce.\n- \\(y\\): The number of containers of Oil Max Pro to produce.\n\nThese variables represent the number of containers of each type of car oil to produce.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize total profit: \\(Z = 10x + 15y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total profit based on the number of containers of each type of car oil produced and their respective profits.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Substance A usage constraint: \\(46x + 13y \\leq 1345\\)\n   - This ensures that the total amount of substance A used in the production of car oils does not exceed the available amount.\n2. Substance B usage constraint: \\(43x + 4y \\leq 346\\)\n   - This ensures that the total amount of substance B used in the production of car oils does not exceed the available amount.\n3. Substance C usage constraint: \\(56x + 45y \\leq 1643\\)\n   - This ensures that the total amount of substance C used in the production of car oils does not exceed the available amount.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of containers of car oils cannot be negative or fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of containers of each type of car oil to produce, maximizing total profit while satisfying the constraints of the substances. This will provide the car manufacturer with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating their production resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the car manufacturer:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the car manufacturer problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CarManufacturerOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Oil Max\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Oil Max Pro\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(46*x + 13*y <= 1345, name=\"SubstanceAConstraint\")  # Substance A usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(43*x + 4*y <= 346, name=\"SubstanceBConstraint\")  # Substance B usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(56*x + 45*y <= 1643, name=\"SubstanceCConstraint\")  # Substance C usage constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(10*x + 15*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production quantities: Oil Max = {x.x} containers, Oil Max Pro = {y.x} containers\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1.

However, at least 10 vintage bottles must be made. How many of each should be made to maximize the total number of bottles produced?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the vine company, we will establish a linear programming model focused on maximizing the total number of bottles produced while satisfying the given constraints. The formulation of the model is as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of vintage bottles produced.\n- \\(y\\): Number of regular bottles produced.\n\nThese variables represent the number of each type of bottle produced to meet the demand for vine.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the total number of bottles: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of bottles produced based on the number of each type of bottle produced.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Total volume of vine does not exceed 100000 ml: \\(500x + 750y \\leq 100000\\)\n   - This ensures that the total volume of all produced bottles does not exceed the available volume of vine.\n2. The number of regular bottles must be at least 4 times as much as the number of vintage bottles: \\(y \\geq 4x\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the market demand that regular bottles are more popular than vintage bottles.\n3. At least 10 vintage bottles must be made: \\(x \\geq 10\\)\n   - This ensures that at least 10 vintage bottles are produced to meet the minimum production requirement.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as bottles cannot be produced in fractions.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of each type of bottle produced to maximize the total number of bottles while satisfying the constraints of vine volume and market demand. This will provide the vine company with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its production resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the vine company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the wine company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"WineBottlingOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of vintage bottles\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of regular bottles\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(500*x + 750*y <= 100000, name=\"TotalVolumeConstraint\")  # Total volume of wine does not exceed 100000 ml\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 4*x, name=\"BottleTypeRatioConstraint\")  # Number of regular bottles must be at least 4 times as much as the number of vintage bottles\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 10, name=\"MinimumVintageBottlesConstraint\")  # At least 10 vintage bottles must be made\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the total number of bottles\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total number of bottles: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production plan: Vintage bottles = {x.x}, Regular bottles = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a COPT environment.\n2. Creates a COPT model named \"WineBottlingOptimization\" for the vine company problem.\n3. Adds two integer decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of vintage and regular bottles produced, respectively.\n4. Adds three constraint conditions:\n   - Total volume of wine does not exceed 100000 ml.\n   - The number of regular bottles must be at least 4 times as much as the number of vintage bottles.\n   - At least 10 vintage bottles must be made.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize the total number of bottles.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, prints the maximized total number of bottles and the optimal production plan (number of vintage and regular bottles).\n   - If no optimal solution is found, prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the vine company using the `coptpy` library, maximizing the total number of bottles while satisfying the given constraints.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the wine company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"WineBottlingOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of vintage bottles\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of regular bottles\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(500*x + 750*y <= 100000, name=\"TotalVolumeConstraint\")  # Total volume of wine does not exceed 100000 ml\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 4*x, name=\"BottleTypeRatioConstraint\")  # Number of regular bottles must be at least 4 times as much as the number of vintage bottles\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 10, name=\"MinimumVintageBottlesConstraint\")  # At least 10 vintage bottles must be made\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the total number of bottles\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total number of bottles: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production plan: Vintage bottles = {x.x}, Regular bottles = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The formulation of the model is as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of kids size bottles made.\n- \\(y\\): Number of adult size bottles made.\n\nThese variables represent the number of each size bottle made to meet the production demand.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the total number of bottles: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of bottles based on the number of each size bottle made.\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

Production ratio constraint between adult and kids size bottles: \\(y \\geq 3x\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the requirement that at least 3 times as many adult size bottles must be made as kids size bottles.\n3. Minimum production constraint for kids size bottles: \\(x \\geq 50\\)\n   - This ensures that at least 50 kids size bottles are made.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as fractional bottles cannot be made.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of each size bottle to be made, maximizing the total number of bottles while satisfying the production constraints.

Nitrous oxide content constraint: \\(1.5x_C + 5x_Y \\geq 5\\)\n   - Ensures that the growth compound contains at least 5 units of nitrous oxide.\n2. Vitamin mix content constraint: \\(3x_C + x_Y \\geq 8\\)\n   - Ensures that the growth compound contains at least 8 units of vitamin mix.\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x_C, x_Y \\geq 0\\)\n  - Ensures that the amounts of fertilizer used are non-negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal amounts of fertilizer C and Y to use, minimizing the total cost while ensuring that the growth compound contains at least 5 units of nitrous oxide and 8 units of vitamin mix. This will provide Ayse with the most cost-effective fertilizer mixing strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for Ayse's fertilizer mixing problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"FertilizerMixing\")\n\n# Add variables representing the amounts of fertilizer C and Y used (in kg)\nx_C = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x_C\")\nx_Y = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x_Y\")\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(1.5*x_C + 5*x_Y >= 5, name=\"NitrogenContent\")\nmodel.addConstr(3*x_C + x_Y >= 8, name=\"VitaminContent\")\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total cost\nmodel.setObjective(2*x_C + 3*x_Y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total cost: ${}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal fertilizer usage: Fertilizer C = {:.2f} kg, Fertilizer Y = {:.2f} kg\".format(x_C.x, x_Y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model.

This will provide John with a scientific decision-making tool to achieve the best economic benefits from his berry farm.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BerryFarmOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_B = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_B\")  # Acres of blueberries planted\nx_R = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_R\")  # Acres of raspberries planted\n\n# Objective function: Maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(56 * x_B + 75 * x_R, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x_B + x_R <= 300, name=\"LandConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(6 * x_B + 3 * x_R <= 575, name=\"LaborConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(22 * x_B + 25 * x_R <= 10000, name=\"WateringConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximum total profit: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Acres of blueberries planted: {:.2f} acres\".format(x_B.x))\n    print(\"Acres of raspberries planted: {:.2f} acres\".format(x_R.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables representing the acres of blueberries and raspberries planted. We set the objective function to maximize total profit and add three constraints: land constraint, labor constraint, and watering cost constraint. Finally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximum total profit and the optimal acres of blueberries and raspberries planted.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for John's berry farm, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BerryFarmOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_B = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_B\")  # Acres of blueberries planted\nx_R = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_R\")  # Acres of raspberries planted\n\n# Objective function: Maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(56 * x_B + 75 * x_R, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x_B + x_R <= 300, name=\"LandConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(6 * x_B + 3 * x_R <= 575, name=\"LaborConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(22 * x_B + 25 * x_R <= 10000, name=\"WateringConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximum total profit: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Acres of blueberries planted: {:.2f} acres\".format(x_B.x))\n    print(\"Acres of raspberries planted: {:.2f} acres\".format(x_R.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1\\): Number of liquid hand sanitizers made.\n- \\(x_2\\): Number of foam hand sanitizers made.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned: \\(Z = 30x_1 + 20x_2\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

Foam hand sanitizers must exceed the number of liquid hand sanitizers: \\(x_2 \\geq x_1\\)\n4. At most 30 liquid hand sanitizers can be made: \\(x_1 \\leq 30\\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2 \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal quantities of liquid and foam hand sanitizers to be made, maximizing the number of hands that can be cleaned while satisfying the constraints of raw material supply and production quantity. This will provide the company with an optimal production strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"HandSanitizerProduction\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of liquid hand sanitizers\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of foam hand sanitizers\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned\nmodel.setObjective(30 * x1 + 20 * x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(40 * x1 + 60 * x2 <= 2000, name=\"WaterSupply\")\nmodel.addConstr(50 * x1 + 40 * x2 <= 2100, name=\"AlcoholSupply\")\nmodel.addConstr(x2 >= x1, name=\"FoamMoreThanLiquid\")\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 30, name=\"LiquidLimit\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized number of hands that can be cleaned: {:.0f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of liquid hand sanitizers made: {:.0f}\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of foam hand sanitizers made: {:.0f}\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of liquid and foam hand sanitizers made, respectively. The objective function is set to maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned, which is `30 * x1 + 20 * x2`.\n\nWe add four constraint conditions:\n1. Water supply constraint: `40 * x1 + 60 * x2 <= 2000`\n2. Alcohol supply constraint: `50 * x1 + 40 * x2 <= 2100`\n3. Foam hand sanitizers must exceed the number of liquid hand sanitizers: `x2 >= x1`\n4. At most 30 liquid hand sanitizers can be made: `x1 <= 30`\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximized number of hands that can be cleaned and the quantities of liquid and foam hand sanitizers made.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the company's production optimization problem, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"HandSanitizerProduction\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of liquid hand sanitizers\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of foam hand sanitizers\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned\nmodel.setObjective(30 * x1 + 20 * x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(40 * x1 + 60 * x2 <= 2000, name=\"WaterSupply\")\nmodel.addConstr(50 * x1 + 40 * x2 <= 2100, name=\"AlcoholSupply\")\nmodel.addConstr(x2 >= x1, name=\"FoamMoreThanLiquid\")\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 30, name=\"LiquidLimit\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized number of hands that can be cleaned: {:.0f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of liquid hand sanitizers made: {:.0f}\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of foam hand sanitizers made: {:.0f}\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:54 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide the soda company with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its delivery resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the soda company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the soda company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SodaCompanyOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of old vans\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of new vans\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(100*x + 80*y >= 5000, name=\"DemandConstraint\")  # Demand of at least 5000 bottles\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 30, name=\"NewVanConstraint\")  # Limit on the use of new vans\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total pollution\nmodel.setObjective(50*x + 30*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total pollution: {model.objval} units\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of vans: Old vans = {x.x}, New vans = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the necessary `coptpy` library and `COPT` constants.\n2. Creates a `COPT` environment and model.\n3. Adds two integer decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of old and new vans used, respectively.\n4.

Sets the objective function to minimize the total pollution: `50*x + 30*y`\n6. Solves the model.\n7.

This will provide the science club with an efficient slime production strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the slime production problem in the science club:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the slime production problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SlimeProduction\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of times table 1 is set up\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of times table 2 is set up\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x1 + 8*x2 <= 100, name=\"PowderConstraint\")  # Powder usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(5*x1 + 6*x2 <= 90, name=\"GlueConstraint\")  # Glue usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(2*x1 + 4*x2 <= 30, name=\"MessConstraint\")  # Mess limit constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the amount of slime produced\nmodel.setObjective(4*x1 + 5*x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized amount of slime produced: {model.objval} units\")\n    print(f\"Number of times table 1 is set up: {x1.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of times table 2 is set up: {x2.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first creates a COPT environment and model. Then, it defines two decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of times table 1 and table 2 are set up, respectively.\n\nNext, the script adds three constraints: the powder usage constraint, the glue usage constraint, and the mess limit constraint. These constraints ensure that the total amount of powder and glue used does not exceed the available quantities and that the total amount of mess produced does not exceed the limit.\n\nThe objective function is set to maximize the amount of slime produced, which is `4*x1 + 5*x2`.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and analyzes the solution. If an optimal solution is found, it prints the maximized amount of slime produced and the number of times each table is set up. If no optimal solution is found, it prints a message indicating this.\n\nThis script provides a concise and effective way to solve the slime production problem in the science club using the `coptpy` library, finding the optimal number of times each table should be set up to maximize the amount of slime produced while satisfying the constraints of available powder and glue and the limit on the amount of mess.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the slime production problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SlimeProduction\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of times table 1 is set up\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of times table 2 is set up\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x1 + 8*x2 <= 100, name=\"PowderConstraint\")  # Powder usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(5*x1 + 6*x2 <= 90, name=\"GlueConstraint\")  # Glue usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(2*x1 + 4*x2 <= 30, name=\"MessConstraint\")  # Mess limit constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the amount of slime produced\nmodel.setObjective(4*x1 + 5*x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized amount of slime produced: {model.objval} units\")\n    print(f\"Number of times table 1 is set up: {x1.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of times table 2 is set up: {x2.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of doses of medicine A to be made.\n- \\(y\\): Number of doses of medicine B to be made.\n\nThese variables represent the number of doses of each medicine that the lab plans to make.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the number of people that can be treated: \\(Z = 12x + 8y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of people that can be treated based on the number of doses of each medicine made and their respective treatment capacities.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Limit on the usage of imported material: \\(30x + 40y \\leq 300\\)\n   - This ensures that the total amount of imported material used for making medicines does not exceed the available 300 units.\n2. Limit on the usage of mRNA: \\(50x + 30y \\leq 400\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the total amount of mRNA used for making medicines does not exceed the available 400 units.\n3. Limit on the number of doses of medicine A: \\(x \\leq 5\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the lab's limit of making at most 5 doses of medicine A.\n4. The number of doses of medicine B must be larger than the number of doses of medicine A: \\(y > x\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the number of doses of medicine B is greater than the number of doses of medicine A.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of doses of medicines cannot be negative or fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of doses of each medicine to be made, maximizing the number of people that can be treated while satisfying the constraints of material usage and production limits. This will provide the lab with the most effective production strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the lab:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the lab problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LabOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of doses of medicine A\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of doses of medicine B\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(30*x + 40*y <= 300, name=\"ImportMaterialConstraint\")  # Limit on the usage of imported material\nmodel.addConstr(50*x + 30*y <= 400, name=\"mRNAConstraint\")  # Limit on the usage of mRNA\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 5, name=\"MedicineAConstraint\")  # Limit on the number of doses of medicine A\nmodel.addConstr(y >= x + 1, name=\"MedicineBConstraint\")  # The number of doses of medicine B must be larger than the number of doses of medicine A\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the number of people that can be treated\nmodel.setObjective(12*x + 8*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized number of people that can be treated: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production plan: Medicine A = {x.x} doses, Medicine B = {y.x} doses\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first import the `coptpy` library and create a COPT environment.\n\n2. Then, we create a COPT model for the lab problem.\n\n3. Next, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of doses of medicine A and medicine B to be made, respectively. These variables are defined as non-negative integers.\n\n4. We add four constraints:\n   - Limit on the usage of imported material: `30*x + 40*y <= 300`\n   - Limit on the usage of mRNA: `50*x + 30*y <= 400`\n   - Limit on the number of doses of medicine A: `x <= 5`\n   - The number of doses of medicine B must be larger than the number of doses of medicine A: `y >= x + 1`\n\n5. We set the objective function to maximize the number of people that can be treated: `12*x + 8*y`.\n\n6. We call the `model.solve()` method to solve the model.\n\n7. Finally, we analyze the solution. If an optimal solution is found, we print the maximized number of people that can be treated and the optimal production plan.

This will provide the patient with an optimal treatment plan.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TreatmentPlan\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x1\")  # Number of minutes machine 1 is used\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x2\")  # Number of minutes machine 2 is used\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(0.5*x1 + 0.3*x2 <= 8, name=\"HeartConstraint\")  # Constraint on the amount of medicine received by the heart\nmodel.addConstr(0.8*x1 + 1*x2 >= 4, name=\"BrainConstraint\")  # Constraint on the amount of medicine received by the brain\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total amount of waste\nmodel.setObjective(0.3*x1 + 0.5*x2, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total amount of waste: {:.2f} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of minutes machine 1 is used: {:.2f}\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of minutes machine 2 is used: {:.2f}\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1.

Then, we add two decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of minutes machine 1 and machine 2 are used, respectively.\n\n3. Next, we add two constraints:\n   - Constraint on the amount of medicine received by the heart: `0.5*x1 + 0.3*x2 <= 8`\n   - Constraint on the amount of medicine received by the brain: `0.8*x1 + 1*x2 >= 4`\n\n4.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1\\): Number of doses of pain killer 1 taken.\n- \\(x_2\\): Number of doses of pain killer 2 taken.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the amount of medicine delivered to the back: \\(Z = 0.8x_1 + 0.4x_2\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Limit on sleep medicine dosage: \\(0.3x_1 + 0.6x_2 \\leq 8\\)\n2. Requirement for leg medicine dosage: \\(0.5x_1 + 0.7x_2 \\geq 4\\)\n3. Non-negativity constraint: \\(x_1, x_2 \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x_1, x_2\\) must be integers, as the number of doses cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of doses of each pain killer to maximize the amount of medicine delivered to the back while satisfying the constraints of sleep medicine dosage and leg medicine dosage. This will provide the patient with the most effective pain relief treatment.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"PainkillerOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of doses of pain killer 1\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of doses of pain killer 2\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the amount of medicine delivered to the back\nmodel.setObjective(0.8 * x1 + 0.4 * x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(0.3 * x1 + 0.6 * x2 <= 8, name=\"SleepingMedConstraint\")  # Limit on sleep medicine dosage\nmodel.addConstr(0.5 * x1 + 0.7 * x2 >= 4, name=\"LegMedConstraint\")  # Requirement for leg medicine dosage\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized amount of medicine delivered to the back: {:.2f} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of doses of pain killer 1: {} doses\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of doses of pain killer 2: {} doses\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two integer decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of doses of pain killer 1 and pain killer 2, respectively.\n\nNext, we set the objective function to maximize the amount of medicine delivered to the back, which is `0.8 * x1 + 0.4 * x2`.\n\nThen, we add two constraints:\n1. Limit on sleep medicine dosage: `0.3 * x1 + 0.6 * x2 <= 8`\n2. Requirement for leg medicine dosage: `0.5 * x1 + 0.7 * x2 >= 4`\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximized amount of medicine delivered to the back and the optimal number of doses of each pain killer.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem of pain killer dosage in the hospital, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"PainkillerOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of doses of pain killer 1\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of doses of pain killer 2\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the amount of medicine delivered to the back\nmodel.setObjective(0.8 * x1 + 0.4 * x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(0.3 * x1 + 0.6 * x2 <= 8, name=\"SleepingMedConstraint\")  # Limit on sleep medicine dosage\nmodel.addConstr(0.5 * x1 + 0.7 * x2 >= 4, name=\"LegMedConstraint\")  # Requirement for leg medicine dosage\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized amount of medicine delivered to the back: {:.2f} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of doses of pain killer 1: {} doses\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of doses of pain killer 2: {} doses\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Here is the detailed formulation of the model:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of servings of noodles.\n- \\(y\\): Number of servings of protein bars.\n\nThese variables represent the number of servings of noodles and protein bars that Bob plans to consume.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total cost: \\(Z = 5x + 2.5y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total cost based on the number of servings of noodles and protein bars consumed and their respective costs.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Calorie intake requirement: \\(600x + 250y \\geq 2000\\)\n   - This ensures that the total calorie intake from noodles and protein bars is at least 2000 calories.\n2. Protein intake requirement: \\(1.5x + 5y \\geq 16\\)\n   - This ensures that the total protein intake from noodles and protein bars is at least 16 grams.\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\), as the number of servings cannot be negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of servings of noodles and protein bars that Bob should consume to minimize the cost of the diet while meeting his daily calorie and protein intake requirements. This will provide Bob with an economically efficient diet plan.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for Bob's diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BobDietOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of servings of noodles\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of servings of protein bars\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(600*x + 250*y >= 2000, name=\"CalorieRequirement\")  # Calorie intake requirement\nmodel.addConstr(1.5*x + 5*y >= 16, name=\"ProteinRequirement\")  # Protein intake requirement\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total cost\nmodel.setObjective(5*x + 2.5*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total cost: ${model.objval:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of servings: Noodles = {x.x:.2f}, Protein Bars = {y.x:.2f}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of servings of noodles and protein bars, respectively. Next, we add two constraints to ensure that the daily calorie and protein intake meet Bob's requirements. The objective function is set to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the costs of noodles and protein bars.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and analyze the solution. If an optimal solution is found, we print the minimum total cost and the optimal number of servings of noodles and protein bars.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of retail stores open.\n- \\(y\\): The number of factory outlets open.\n\nThese variables represent the number of each type of store that the company plans to open.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the number of stores open: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of stores based on the number of each type of store open.\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

How many times should each test be performed to minimize the total number of probes used?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the chemical company, we will establish a linear programming model focused on minimizing the total number of probes used while satisfying the requirements for the number of tests and the ratio constraint between the tests. The formulation of the model is as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of units of the salinity test performed.\n- \\(y\\): Number of units of the pH test performed.\n\nThese variables represent the number of units of each test performed to meet the testing requirements.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of probes used: \\(Z = 3x + 2y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of probes used based on the number of units of each test performed and their respective probe requirements.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Requirement for the number of pH tests: \\(y \\geq 250\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of units of the pH test performed meets or exceeds the requirement of 250 tests.\n2. Requirement for the total number of tests: \\(x + y \\geq 400\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the total number of tests performed meets or exceeds the requirement of 400 tests.\n3. Ratio constraint between the salinity test and the pH test: \\(y \\leq 1.5x\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the requirement that the number of units of the pH test performed should not exceed 1.5 times the number of units of the salinity test performed.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of units of tests cannot be performed in fractions.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of units of each test performed to minimize the total number of probes used while satisfying the testing requirements and adhering to the ratio constraint between the tests. This will provide the chemical company with the most cost-effective strategy for allocating its testing resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the chemical company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the chemical company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ChemicalCompanyOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of units of the salinity test\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of units of the pH test\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 250, name=\"pHTestRequirement\")  # Requirement for the number of pH tests\nmodel.addConstr(x + y >= 400, name=\"TotalTestRequirement\")  # Requirement for the total number of tests\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 1.5*x, name=\"TestRatioConstraint\")  # Ratio constraint between the tests\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of probes used\nmodel.setObjective(3*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of probes used: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of units of the salinity test: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of units of the pH test: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"ChemicalCompanyOptimization\" for the chemical company problem.\n3. Adds two integer decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the number of units of the salinity test and the pH test, respectively.\n4. Adds three constraint conditions:\n   - Requirement for the number of pH tests: `y >= 250`\n   - Requirement for the total number of tests: `x + y >= 400`\n   - Ratio constraint between the tests: `y <= 1.5*x`\n5. Sets the objective function to minimize the total number of probes used: `3*x + 2*y`.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, prints the minimum total number of probes used and the optimal number of units of the salinity test and the pH test.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the chemical company using the `coptpy` library, minimizing the total number of probes used while satisfying the testing requirements and adhering to the ratio constraint between the tests.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the chemical company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ChemicalCompanyOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of units of the salinity test\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of units of the pH test\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 250, name=\"pHTestRequirement\")  # Requirement for the number of pH tests\nmodel.addConstr(x + y >= 400, name=\"TotalTestRequirement\")  # Requirement for the total number of tests\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 1.5*x, name=\"TestRatioConstraint\")  # Ratio constraint between the tests\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of probes used\nmodel.setObjective(3*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of probes used: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of units of the salinity test: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of units of the pH test: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The objective function is to minimize the total number of trips, which is `x + y`.\n\nWe add two constraints:\n1. `20 * x + 15 * y >= 500` ensures that at least 500 boxes of corn are sent.\n2. `y >= 4 * x` ensures that the number of light rail trips is at least 4 times the number of ferry trips.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the minimum total number of trips and the number of trips for each type.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the farmer's corn transportation problem while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CornTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of ferry trips\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of light rail trips\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of trips\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(20 * x + 15 * y >= 500, name=\"MinCornConstraint\")  # At least 500 boxes of corn are sent\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 4 * x, name=\"RailwayConstraint\")  # Number of light rail trips is at least 4 times the number of ferry trips\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total number of trips: {}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of ferry trips: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of light rail trips: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:55 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of helicopter and bus trips, respectively.\n\nNext, we add three constraints:\n1. Patient quantity constraint: Ensures that the total number of patients transported by helicopter and bus is at least 120.\n2. Trip type ratio constraint: Ensures that at least 30% of the trips are by helicopter.\n3. Trip quantity constraint: Ensures that the number of bus trips does not exceed 10.\n\nThen, we set the objective function to minimize the total time, which is `x + 3*y`.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results, including the minimum total time and the optimal number of helicopter and bus trips.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem of transporting patients to the hospital, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"PatientTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of helicopter trips\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of bus trips\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 8*y >= 120, name=\"PatientConstraint\")  # Patient quantity constraint\nmodel.addConstr(0.7*x - 0.3*y >= 0, name=\"HelicopterRatioConstraint\")  # Trip type ratio constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 10, name=\"BusConstraint\")  # Trip quantity constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total time\nmodel.setObjective(x + 3*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total time: {:.2f} hours\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of helicopter trips: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of bus trips: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a COPT environment.\n2. Creates a COPT model named \"LawnMowingServiceOptimization\" for the lawn mowing service problem.\n3. Adds two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of small teams and large teams, respectively, and specifies them as non-negative integers.\n4. Adds four constraints:\n   - Employee usage constraint: The total number of employees used does not exceed 150.\n   - Small team quantity constraint: There must be at least 10 small teams.\n   - Large team quantity constraint: There must be at least 6 large teams.\n   - Team ratio constraint: The number of small teams must be at least 3 times as much as the number of large teams.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize the amount of lawn that can be mowed, which is 50*x + 80*y.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the maximized amount of lawn that can be mowed and the optimal team quantities.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the lawn mowing service using the `coptpy` library, maximizing the amount of lawn that can be mowed while satisfying the given constraints.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the lawn mowing service problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LawnMowingServiceOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of small teams\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of large teams\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y <= 150, name=\"EmployeeUsageConstraint\")  # Employee usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 6, name=\"SmallTeamConstraint\")  # Small team quantity constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 6, name=\"LargeTeamConstraint\")  # Large team quantity constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 3*y, name=\"TeamRatioConstraint\")  # Small team quantity must be at least 3 times as much as the number of large teams\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the amount of lawn that can be mowed\nmodel.setObjective(50*x + 80*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized amount of lawn that can be mowed: {model.objval} sq ft\")\n    print(f\"Optimal team quantities: Small teams = {x.x}, Large teams = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Sets the objective function to maximize total profit, with a profit of $500 per acre of potatoes and $650 per acre of cucumbers.\n6. Solves the model.\n7.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of manual slicers to buy.\n- \\(y\\): The number of automatic slicers to buy.\n\nThese variables represent the number of each type of slicer to buy to meet the cutting requirements.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of slicers: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of slicers based on the number of each type of slicer bought.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Cutting requirement of at least 50 slices per minute: \\(5x + 8y \\geq 50\\)\n   - This ensures that the total number of slicers bought meets or exceeds the requirement of cutting 50 slices per minute.\n2. Grease usage limit of 35 units per minute: \\(3x + 6y \\leq 35\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limit on the use of grease due to the requirement of the slicers.\n3. The number of manual slicers must be less than the number of automatic slicers: \\(x < y\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the number of manual slicers is less than the number of automatic slicers.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of slicers cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of each type of slicer to buy, minimizing the total number of slicers while meeting the cutting requirements and adhering to the constraints on grease usage and the number of manual slicers. This will provide the butcher shop with the most cost-effective strategy to allocate its resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the butcher shop:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the butcher shop problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ButcherShopOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of manual slicers\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of automatic slicers\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 8*y >= 50, name=\"CuttingDemandConstraint\")  # Cutting requirement of at least 50 slices per minute\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 6*y <= 35, name=\"GreaseUsageConstraint\")  # Grease usage limit of 35 units per minute\nmodel.addConstr(x < y, name=\"ManualSlicerConstraint\")  # Number of manual slicers must be less than the number of automatic slicers\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of slicers\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of slicers: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal slicer quantities: Manual slicers = {x.x}, Automatic slicers = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"ButcherShopOptimization\" for the butcher shop problem.\n3. Adds two integer decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the number of manual and automatic slicers to buy, respectively.\n4. Adds three constraint conditions:\n   - Cutting requirement of at least 50 slices per minute: `5*x + 8*y >= 50`\n   - Grease usage limit of 35 units per minute: `3*x + 6*y <= 35`\n   - Number of manual slicers must be less than the number of automatic slicers: `x < y`\n5. Sets the objective function to minimize the total number of slicers: `x + y`\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, prints the minimum total number of slicers and the optimal quantities of each type of slicer.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the butcher shop using the `coptpy` library, minimizing the total number of slicers while meeting the cutting requirements and adhering to the constraints on grease usage and the number of manual slicers.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the butcher shop problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ButcherShopOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of manual slicers\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of automatic slicers\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 8*y >= 50, name=\"CuttingDemandConstraint\")  # Cutting requirement of at least 50 slices per minute\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 6*y <= 35, name=\"GreaseUsageConstraint\")  # Grease usage limit of 35 units per minute\nmodel.addConstr(x < y, name=\"ManualSlicerConstraint\")  # Number of manual slicers must be less than the number of automatic slicers\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of slicers\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of slicers: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal slicer quantities: Manual slicers = {x.x}, Automatic slicers = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

At least 30 pill vaccines: \\( x \\geq 30 \\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\( x, y \\geq 0 \\)\n\nThrough this model, we can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of pill and shot vaccines to administer, maximizing the number of patients that can be vaccinated while satisfying the time constraint and the requirement for the number of vaccines.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"VaccineOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of pill vaccines\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of shot vaccines\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the number of patients vaccinated\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10 * x + 20 * y <= 10000, name=\"TimeConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 3 * x, name=\"VaccineRatioConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 30, name=\"MinPillConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized number of patients vaccinated: {:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of pill vaccines: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of shot vaccines: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of pill and shot vaccines administered, respectively. The objective function is to maximize the number of patients vaccinated, which is `x + y`.\n\nWe add three constraints:\n1. Time constraint: The total time for administering pill and shot vaccines cannot exceed 10000 minutes.\n2. At least 3 times as many shots as pill.\n3. At least 30 pill vaccines.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximized number of patients vaccinated and the number of pill and shot vaccines administered.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the clinic vaccine administration problem while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"VaccineOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of pill vaccines\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of shot vaccines\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the number of patients vaccinated\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10 * x + 20 * y <= 10000, name=\"TimeConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 3 * x, name=\"VaccineRatioConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 30, name=\"MinPillConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized number of patients vaccinated: {:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of pill vaccines: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of shot vaccines: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide the clinic with the most efficient strategy for allocating its resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the clinic:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the clinic problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ClinicOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of throat swabs\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of nasal swabs\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 30, name=\"NoseSwabMinimum\")  # Minimum requirement for nasal swabs\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 4*y, name=\"ThroatToNoseRatio\")  # Ratio constraint between throat and nasal swabs\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 3*y <= 20000, name=\"ClinicTimeLimit\")  # Time constraint for the clinic\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the number of patients seen\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized number of patients seen: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of throat swabs: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of nasal swabs: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"ClinicOptimization\" for the clinic problem.\n3. Adds two decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the number of throat swabs and nasal swabs, respectively. These variables are defined as non-negative integers.\n4. Adds three constraints:\n   - Minimum requirement for nasal swabs: `y >= 30`\n   - Ratio constraint between throat and nasal swabs: `x >= 4*y`\n   - Time constraint for the clinic: `5*x + 3*y <= 20000`\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize the number of patients seen: `x + y`.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the maximized number of patients seen and the optimal number of throat swabs and nasal swabs.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the clinic using the `coptpy` library, maximizing the number of patients seen while satisfying the given constraints.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the clinic problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ClinicOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of throat swabs\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of nasal swabs\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 30, name=\"NoseSwabMinimum\")  # Minimum requirement for nasal swabs\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 4*y, name=\"ThroatToNoseRatio\")  # Ratio constraint between throat and nasal swabs\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 3*y <= 20000, name=\"ClinicTimeLimit\")  # Time constraint for the clinic\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the number of patients seen\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized number of patients seen: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of throat swabs: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of nasal swabs: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

If excess sugar makes the gorilla aggressive, how many of each fruit should he consume to minimize his sugar intake?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the gorilla's diet problem, we need to construct a linear programming model to minimize his sugar intake while ensuring sufficient calorie and potassium intake, as well as the proportion of fruit consumption. Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of bananas consumed (in units).\n- \\(y\\): Number of mangoes consumed (in units).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize sugar intake: \\(Z = 10x + 8y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total sugar intake based on the number of bananas and mangoes consumed and their respective sugar content.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Calorie intake constraint: \\(80x + 100y \\geq 4000\\)\n   - This ensures that the gorilla consumes at least 4000 calories.\n2. Potassium intake constraint: \\(20x + 15y \\geq 150\\)\n   - This ensures that the gorilla consumes at least 150 grams of potassium.\n3. Mango proportion constraint: \\(y \\leq 0.33(x + y)\\)\n   - This ensures that the proportion of mangoes does not exceed 33% of the total fruit consumption.\n4. Non-negativity constraint: \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of bananas and mangoes consumed is non-negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of bananas and mangoes to consume, minimizing sugar intake while satisfying the gorilla's calorie and potassium intake requirements and the proportion of fruit consumption. This will provide the zookeeper with an optimal feeding strategy to ensure the gorilla's health and happiness.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the gorilla's diet problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the gorilla's diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"GorillaDietOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of bananas\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of mangoes\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(80*x + 100*y >= 4000, name=\"CalorieConstraint\")  # Calorie intake constraint\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 15*y >= 150, name=\"PotassiumConstraint\")  # Potassium intake constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 0.33*(x + y), name=\"MangoProportionConstraint\")  # Mango proportion constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize sugar intake\nmodel.setObjective(10*x + 8*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum sugar intake: {model.objval} grams\")\n    print(f\"Optimal diet: Bananas = {x.x} units, Mangoes = {y.x} units\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of bananas and mangoes consumed, respectively.\n\nNext, we add three constraints:\n1. Calorie intake constraint: Ensures that the gorilla consumes at least 4000 calories.\n2. Potassium intake constraint: Ensures that the gorilla consumes at least 150 grams of potassium.\n3. Mango proportion constraint: Ensures that the proportion of mangoes does not exceed 33% of the total fruit consumption.\n\nThen, we set the objective function to minimize sugar intake, which is `10*x + 8*y`.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and analyze the solution. If an optimal solution is found, we print the minimum sugar intake and the optimal diet (number of bananas and mangoes). If no optimal solution is found, we print the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the gorilla's diet problem, considering all the given constraints and the objective function.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the gorilla's diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"GorillaDietOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of bananas\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of mangoes\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(80*x + 100*y >= 4000, name=\"CalorieConstraint\")  # Calorie intake constraint\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 15*y >= 150, name=\"PotassiumConstraint\")  # Potassium intake constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 0.33*(x + y), name=\"MangoProportionConstraint\")  # Mango proportion constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize sugar intake\nmodel.setObjective(10*x + 8*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum sugar intake: {model.objval} grams\")\n    print(f\"Optimal diet: Bananas = {x.x} units, Mangoes = {y.x} units\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide the airport with an economically efficient vehicle purchase strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"AirportVehicleOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_4 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_4\")  # Number of 4-wheeler vehicles\nx_3 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_3\")  # Number of 3-wheeler vehicles\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of vehicles\nmodel.setObjective(x_4 + x_3, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Luggage movement requirement\nmodel.addConstr(60 * x_4 + 40 * x_3 >= 1000, name=\"LuggageRequirement\")\n\n# Pollutant emission constraint\nmodel.addConstr(30 * x_4 + 15 * x_3 <= 430, name=\"PollutionLimit\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total number of vehicles: {}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of 4-wheeler vehicles: {}\".format(x_4.x))\n    print(\"Number of 3-wheeler vehicles: {}\".format(x_3.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two integer decision variables, `x_4` and `x_3`, representing the number of 4-wheeler and 3-wheeler vehicles to buy, respectively.\n\nNext, we set the objective function to minimize the total number of vehicles, which is `x_4 + x_3`.\n\nThen, we add two constraints:\n1. Luggage movement requirement: `60 * x_4 + 40 * x_3 >= 1000`, ensuring that the purchased vehicles can move at least 1000 luggage per day.\n2.

Medicine requirement for the throat: \\(0.5x_1 + 0.2x_2 \\geq 5\\)\n   - This ensures that the patient receives at least 5 units of medicine for the throat.\n2. Medicine requirement for the lungs: \\(0.4x_1 + 0.5x_2 \\geq 4\\)\n   - This ensures that the patient receives at least 4 units of medicine for the lungs.\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2 \\geq 0\\), as the number of servings cannot be negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of servings of each syrup to drink, minimizing sugar intake while satisfying the medicine requirements for the throat and lungs. This will provide the patient with an optimal treatment plan.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the patient's treatment problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ThroatTreatmentOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x1\")  # Number of servings of syrup 1\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x2\")  # Number of servings of syrup 2\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(0.5*x1 + 0.2*x2 >= 5, name=\"ThroatMedicineRequirement\")  # Medicine requirement for the throat\nmodel.addConstr(0.4*x1 + 0.5*x2 >= 4, name=\"LungMedicineRequirement\")  # Medicine requirement for the lungs\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize sugar intake\nmodel.setObjective(0.5*x1 + 0.3*x2, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum sugar intake: {model.objval} units\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of servings: Syrup 1 = {x1.x}, Syrup 2 = {x2.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of servings of syrup 1 and syrup 2 to drink.\n\nNext, we add two constraints to ensure that the medicine requirements for the throat and lungs are met.\n\nThe objective function is set to minimize sugar intake, which is `0.5*x1 + 0.3*x2`.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and analyze the solution.

How many of each sandwich should be made to maximize profit?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the breakfast joint, we will establish a linear programming model focused on maximizing the total profit of the sandwiches while adhering to the constraints on the supply of eggs and bacon. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of regular sandwiches made.\n- \\(y\\): The number of special sandwiches made.\n\nThese variables represent the quantities of each type of sandwich made to maximize profit.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize total profit: \\(Z = 3x + 4y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total profit based on the quantities of each type of sandwich made and their respective profits.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Egg supply constraint: \\(2x + 3y \\leq 40\\)\n   - This ensures that the total number of eggs used for making sandwiches does not exceed the available supply of eggs.\n2. Bacon supply constraint: \\(3x + 5y \\leq 70\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limitation on the use of bacon for making sandwiches due to the limited supply of bacon.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the quantities of sandwiches cannot be negative or fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal quantities of each type of sandwich to be made, maximizing total profit while satisfying the constraints on the supply of eggs and bacon. This will provide the breakfast joint with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its sandwich-making resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the breakfast joint:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the breakfast joint problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BreakfastJointOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Regular sandwich\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Special sandwich\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2*x + 3*y <= 40, name=\"EggSupplyConstraint\")  # Egg supply constraint\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y <= 70, name=\"BaconSupplyConstraint\")  # Bacon supply constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(3*x + 4*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal quantities of sandwiches: Regular = {x.x}, Special = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"BreakfastJointOptimization\" for the breakfast joint problem.\n3. Adds two non-negative integer variables `x` and `y`, representing the quantities of regular and special sandwiches made, respectively.\n4. Adds two constraints:\n   - Egg supply constraint: The total number of eggs used for making sandwiches does not exceed 40.\n   - Bacon supply constraint: The total number of slices of bacon used for making sandwiches does not exceed 70.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize total profit, which is $3 per regular sandwich and $4 per special sandwich.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the maximized total profit and the optimal quantities of each type of sandwich.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a concise method to solve the optimization problem for the breakfast joint using the `coptpy` library, considering the constraints on the supply of eggs and bacon and the objective of maximizing profit.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the breakfast joint problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BreakfastJointOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Regular sandwich\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Special sandwich\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2*x + 3*y <= 40, name=\"EggSupplyConstraint\")  # Egg supply constraint\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y <= 70, name=\"BaconSupplyConstraint\")  # Bacon supply constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(3*x + 4*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal quantities of sandwiches: Regular = {x.x}, Special = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The objective function is set to minimize the total baking time, which is `12 * x_L + 8 * x_M`.\n\nWe add four constraint conditions:\n1.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_L\\): Number of long desks purchased.\n- \\(x_S\\): Number of short desks purchased.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize seating availability: \\(Z = 6x_L + 2x_S\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of seats based on the number of employees each type of desk can accommodate.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Budget constraint: \\(300x_L + 100x_S \\leq 2000\\)\n   - This ensures that the total cost of purchasing desks does not exceed $2000.\n2. Space constraint: \\(10x_L + 4x_S \\leq 200\\)\n   - This ensures that the total space occupied by the desks does not exceed 200 square feet.\n3. Non-negativity constraint: \\(x_L, x_S \\geq 0\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of desks purchased is non-negative.\n\n### Integer constraint:\n- \\(x_L, x_S\\) must be integers, as desks cannot be purchased in fractions.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of long and short desks to purchase, maximizing seating availability while satisfying the budget and space constraints. This will provide an efficient office space design solution.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the office space design problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"OfficeSpaceDesign\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_L = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_L\")  # Number of long desks\nx_S = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_S\")  # Number of short desks\n\n# Objective function: Maximize seating availability\nmodel.setObjective(6 * x_L + 2 * x_S, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Budget constraint\nmodel.addConstr(300 * x_L + 100 * x_S <= 2000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")\n\n# Space constraint\nmodel.addConstr(10 * x_L + 4 * x_S <= 200, name=\"SpaceConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized seating availability: {} employees\".format(int(model.objval)))\n    print(\"Number of long desks: {}\".format(int(x_L.x)))\n    print(\"Number of short desks: {}\".format(int(x_S.x)))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first import the `coptpy` library and create a COPT environment and model.\n\n2. Then, we add two decision variables `x_L` and `x_S`, representing the number of long and short desks to purchase, respectively. These variables are defined as integer types.\n\n3. Next, we set the objective function, which is to maximize seating availability. The objective function is `6 * x_L + 2 * x_S`, where 6 and 2 represent the number of employees each long and short desk can accommodate, respectively.\n\n4. We add two constraints:\n   - Budget constraint: `300 * x_L + 100 * x_S <= 2000`, ensuring that the total cost of purchasing desks does not exceed $2000.\n   - Space constraint: `10 * x_L + 4 * x_S <= 200`, ensuring that the total space occupied by the desks does not exceed 200 square feet.\n\n5. We call `model.solve()` to solve the model.\n\n6. Finally, we check the solution status of the model. If an optimal solution is found, we output the maximized seating availability and the number of long and short desks to purchase. Otherwise, we output a message indicating that no optimal solution was found.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the office space design problem, helping you find the optimal desk purchasing strategy to maximize seating availability while satisfying the budget and space constraints.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"OfficeSpaceDesign\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_L = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_L\")  # Number of long desks\nx_S = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_S\")  # Number of short desks\n\n# Objective function: Maximize seating availability\nmodel.setObjective(6 * x_L + 2 * x_S, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Budget constraint\nmodel.addConstr(300 * x_L + 100 * x_S <= 2000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")\n\n# Space constraint\nmodel.addConstr(10 * x_L + 4 * x_S <= 200, name=\"SpaceConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized seating availability: {} employees\".format(int(model.objval)))\n    print(\"Number of long desks: {}\".format(int(x_L.x)))\n    print(\"Number of short desks: {}\".format(int(x_S.x)))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide Zeta Bakery with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its production resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for Zeta Bakery:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for Zeta Bakery's production problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ZetaBakeryProduction\")\n\n# Add variables for the quantities of strawberry and sugar cookies produced\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Quantity of strawberry cookies\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Quantity of sugar cookies\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 100, name=\"StrawberryDemandConstraint\")  # Demand for strawberry cookies\nmodel.addConstr(x2 <= 80, name=\"SugarDemandConstraint\")  # Demand for sugar cookies\nmodel.addConstr(x1 + x2 <= 100, name=\"ProductionCapacityConstraint\")  # Production capacity constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(5.5*x1 + 12*x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production plan: Strawberry cookies = {x1.x}, Sugar cookies = {x2.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"ZetaBakeryProduction\" for Zeta Bakery's production problem.\n3. Adds two non-negative integer variables, `x1` and `x2`, representing the quantities of strawberry and sugar cookies produced.\n4. Adds three constraints:\n   - Demand for strawberry cookies: `x1 <= 100`\n   - Demand for sugar cookies: `x2 <= 80`\n   - Production capacity constraint: `x1 + x2 <= 100`\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize total profit: `5.5*x1 + 12*x2`.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, prints the maximized total profit and the optimal production plan.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a concise method to solve the optimization problem for Zeta Bakery using the `coptpy` library, considering all the given constraints and objectives.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for Zeta Bakery's production problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ZetaBakeryProduction\")\n\n# Add variables for the quantities of strawberry and sugar cookies produced\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Quantity of strawberry cookies\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Quantity of sugar cookies\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 100, name=\"StrawberryDemandConstraint\")  # Demand for strawberry cookies\nmodel.addConstr(x2 <= 80, name=\"SugarDemandConstraint\")  # Demand for sugar cookies\nmodel.addConstr(x1 + x2 <= 100, name=\"ProductionCapacityConstraint\")  # Production capacity constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(5.5*x1 + 12*x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production plan: Strawberry cookies = {x1.x}, Sugar cookies = {x2.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of gas grills to be bought.\n- \\(y\\): The number of electric grills to be bought.\n\nThese variables represent the number of each type of grill to be bought to meet the cooking requirements.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of grills: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of grills based on the number of each type of grill bought.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Cooking requirement of at least 150 patties per minute: \\(20x + 30y \\geq 150\\)\n   - This ensures that the total number of bought grills meets or exceeds the requirement of cooking 150 patties per minute.\n2. Cooking oil usage of at most 140 units per minute: \\(20x + 25y \\leq 140\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limitation on the usage of cooking oil.\n3. The number of electric grills must be less than the number of gas grills: \\(y \\leq x\\)\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of grills cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of each type of grill to be bought, minimizing the total number of grills while meeting the cooking requirements and adhering to the constraints on cooking oil usage and the number of electric grills. This will provide the burger chain with the most cost-effective strategy to allocate its cooking resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the burger chain:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the burger chain problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BurgerChainOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of gas grills\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of electric grills\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 30*y >= 150, name=\"CookingDemandConstraint\")  # Cooking demand of at least 150 patties per minute\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 25*y <= 140, name=\"CookingOilUsageConstraint\")  # Cooking oil usage of at most 140 units per minute\nmodel.addConstr(y <= x, name=\"ElectricGrillConstraint\")  # Number of electric grills must be less than the number of gas grills\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of grills\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of grills: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of grills: Gas grills = {x.x}, Electric grills = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"BurgerChainOptimization\" for the burger chain problem.\n3. Adds two integer decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the number of gas grills and electric grills to be bought, respectively.\n4. Adds three constraint conditions:\n   - Cooking demand of at least 150 patties per minute: `20*x + 30*y >= 150`\n   - Cooking oil usage of at most 140 units per minute: `20*x + 25*y <= 140`\n   - Number of electric grills must be less than the number of gas grills: `y <= x`\n5. Sets the objective function to minimize the total number of grills: `x + y`\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, prints the minimum total number of grills and the optimal number of each type of grill.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the burger chain using the `coptpy` library, helping the chain determine the optimal number of each type of grill to minimize the total number of grills while meeting the cooking requirements and adhering to the constraints on cooking oil usage and the number of electric grills.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the burger chain problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BurgerChainOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of gas grills\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of electric grills\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 30*y >= 150, name=\"CookingDemandConstraint\")  # Cooking demand of at least 150 patties per minute\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 25*y <= 140, name=\"CookingOilUsageConstraint\")  # Cooking oil usage of at most 140 units per minute\nmodel.addConstr(y <= x, name=\"ElectricGrillConstraint\")  # Number of electric grills must be less than the number of gas grills\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of grills\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of grills: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of grills: Gas grills = {x.x}, Electric grills = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:57 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

What is the minimum cost diet that the company can provide for its workers?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the car manufacturing company, we will establish a linear programming model focused on minimizing the total cost of the diet while meeting the nutritional requirements. The following is the formulation of the model:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of hamburgers provided.\n- \\(y\\): Number of chicken wraps provided.\n\nThese variables represent the quantities of each food item provided to meet the nutritional requirements of the workers.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total cost: \\(Z = 6.5x + 4y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total cost based on the quantities of each food item provided and their respective costs.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Calorie requirement of at least 2200 calories: \\(800x + 450y \\geq 2200\\)\n   - This ensures that the total calories provided meet or exceed the requirement of 2200 calories.\n2. Protein requirement of at least 50 grams: \\(19x + 12y \\geq 50\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the requirement of providing at least 50 grams of protein.\n3. Carbohydrate requirement of at least 70 grams: \\(20x + 10y \\geq 70\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the total carbohydrates provided meet or exceed the requirement of 70 grams.\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\), as the quantities of food items cannot be negative.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal quantities of each food item to provide, minimizing the total cost while meeting the nutritional requirements of the workers. This will provide the car manufacturing company with the most cost-effective strategy to allocate its food resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the car manufacturing company's diet:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the car manufacturing company's diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CarManufacturingCompanyDietOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of hamburgers\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of chicken wraps\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(800*x + 450*y >= 2200, name=\"CalorieConstraint\")  # Calorie requirement\nmodel.addConstr(19*x + 12*y >= 50, name=\"ProteinConstraint\")  # Protein requirement\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 10*y >= 70, name=\"CarbohydrateConstraint\")  # Carbohydrate requirement\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total cost\nmodel.setObjective(6.5*x + 4*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total cost: ${model.objval:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal diet: Hamburgers = {x.x:.0f}, Chicken Wraps = {y.x:.0f}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"CarManufacturingCompanyDietOptimization\".\n3. Adds two non-negative continuous decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the number of hamburgers and chicken wraps, respectively.\n4.

Basketballs require 5 units of materials and 1 hour to make whereas footballs require 3 units of materials and 2 hours to make. The manufacturing company has available 1500 units of materials and their workers working at max capacity can work for at most 750 hours. Since basketballs sell better, there must be at least three times as many basketballs as footballs but the manufacturing company would like at least 50 footballs. How many of each should the manufacturing company make to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the handmade sports equipment manufacturing company, we will establish a linear programming model to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced while satisfying the constraints of materials, labor, and product ratio. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of basketballs to be made.\n- \\(y\\): The number of footballs to be made.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the total number of sports equipment produced: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Material usage constraint: \\(5x + 3y \\leq 1500\\)\n2. Labor time constraint: \\(x + 2y \\leq 750\\)\n3. Product ratio constraint: \\(x \\geq 3y\\) (At least three times as many basketballs as footballs)\n4. Minimum number of footballs constraint: \\(y \\geq 50\\)\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer constraints:\n- \\(x, y\\) must be integers, as the quantities of sports equipment cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal quantities of basketballs and footballs to be made, maximizing the total number of sports equipment produced while satisfying the constraints of materials, labor, and product ratio. This will provide the manufacturing company with an optimized production strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the handmade sports equipment manufacturing company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the handmade sports equipment manufacturing company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"HandmadeSportsEquipmentOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of basketballs\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of footballs\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 3*y <= 1500, name=\"MaterialConstraint\")  # Material usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x + 2*y <= 750, name=\"LaborConstraint\")  # Labor time constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 3*y, name=\"ProductRatioConstraint\")  # Product ratio constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 50, name=\"MinimumFootballConstraint\")  # Minimum number of footballs constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total number of sports equipment: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production plan: Basketball = {x.x}, Football = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first creates a COPT environment and model. Then, it defines two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of basketballs and footballs to be made, respectively.\n\nNext, the script adds four constraint conditions:\n1. Material usage constraint: The total amount of materials required for making basketballs and footballs cannot exceed 1500 units.\n2. Labor time constraint: The total labor time required for making basketballs and footballs cannot exceed 750 hours.\n3. Product ratio constraint: The number of basketballs must be at least three times the number of footballs.\n4. Minimum number of footballs constraint: At least 50 footballs must be made.\n\nThe objective function is set to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced, i.e., `x + y`.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the optimal solution (if found). It prints the maximized total number of sports equipment and the optimal production plan, i.e., the quantities of basketballs and footballs to be made.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the handmade sports equipment manufacturing company, considering all the given constraints and objectives.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the handmade sports equipment manufacturing company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"HandmadeSportsEquipmentOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of basketballs\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of footballs\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 3*y <= 1500, name=\"MaterialConstraint\")  # Material usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x + 2*y <= 750, name=\"LaborConstraint\")  # Labor time constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 3*y, name=\"ProductRatioConstraint\")  # Product ratio constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 50, name=\"MinimumFootballConstraint\")  # Minimum number of footballs constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total number of sports equipment: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal production plan: Basketball = {x.x}, Football = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Non-negativity constraints: \\(x_A, x_H \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal investment amounts in apartments and townhouses that maximize the total profit while satisfying all the constraints. This will provide my family with a wise investment decision.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"RealEstateInvestment\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_A = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_A\")  # Amount of money invested in apartments\nx_H = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_H\")  # Amount of money invested in townhouses\n\n# Objective function: Maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(0.10 * x_A + 0.15 * x_H, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x_A + x_H <= 600000, name=\"TotalInvestment\")\nmodel.addConstr(x_A <= 200000, name=\"ApartmentLimit\")\nmodel.addConstr(x_H >= 0.5 * x_A, name=\"HouseLimit\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized total profit: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Amount of money invested in apartments: ${:.2f}\".format(x_A.x))\n    print(\"Amount of money invested in townhouses: ${:.2f}\".format(x_H.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables representing the amounts of money invested in apartments and townhouses. We set the objective function to maximize the total profit and add three constraints to ensure that the total investment amount does not exceed $600,000, the investment amount in apartments does not exceed $200,000, and the investment amount in townhouses is at least a half as much as that in apartments. Finally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximized total profit and the optimal investment amounts in apartments and townhouses.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the real estate investment problem for my family, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"RealEstateInvestment\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_A = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_A\")  # Amount of money invested in apartments\nx_H = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x_H\")  # Amount of money invested in townhouses\n\n# Objective function: Maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(0.10 * x_A + 0.15 * x_H, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x_A + x_H <= 600000, name=\"TotalInvestment\")\nmodel.addConstr(x_A <= 200000, name=\"ApartmentLimit\")\nmodel.addConstr(x_H >= 0.5 * x_A, name=\"HouseLimit\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized total profit: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Amount of money invested in apartments: ${:.2f}\".format(x_A.x))\n    print(\"Amount of money invested in townhouses: ${:.2f}\".format(x_H.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Minimum number of large sized carts: \\(y \\geq 5\\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of medium and large sized carts to maximize the amount of rice transported while satisfying the constraints on the number of horses and the ratio of cart sizes. This will provide the factory with an optimal transportation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CartTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of medium sized carts\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of large sized carts\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the amount of rice transported\nmodel.setObjective(30 * x + 70 * y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2 * x + 4 * y <= 60, name=\"HorseLimit\")\nmodel.addConstr(x == 3 * y, name=\"CartRatio\")\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 5, name=\"MinMediumCarts\")\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 5, name=\"MinLargeCarts\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized amount of rice transported: {:.2f} kg\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of medium sized carts: {:.0f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of large sized carts: {:.0f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of medium and large sized carts, respectively. The objective function is set to maximize the amount of rice transported, which is `30 * x + 70 * y`.\n\nWe add four constraint conditions:\n1. Horse quantity constraint: `2 * x + 4 * y <= 60`\n2. Ratio constraint between medium and large sized carts: `x == 3 * y`\n3. Minimum number of medium sized carts: `x >= 5`\n4. Minimum number of large sized carts: `y >= 5`\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximized amount of rice transported and the number of medium and large sized carts.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the factory's transportation problem while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CartTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of medium sized carts\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of large sized carts\n\n# Objective function: Maximize the amount of rice transported\nmodel.setObjective(30 * x + 70 * y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2 * x + 4 * y <= 60, name=\"HorseLimit\")\nmodel.addConstr(x == 3 * y, name=\"CartRatio\")\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 5, name=\"MinMediumCarts\")\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 5, name=\"MinLargeCarts\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized amount of rice transported: {:.2f} kg\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of medium sized carts: {:.0f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of large sized carts: {:.0f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of orange juice boxes to drink.\n- \\(y\\): Number of apple juice boxes to drink.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize total vitamin D intake: \\(Z = 10x + 12y\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Vitamin C intake limit: \\(8x + 6y \\leq 300\\)\n2. Juice box preference: \\(y \\geq 3x\\)\n3. Minimum orange juice box requirement: \\(x \\geq 3\\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of orange and apple juice boxes to drink, maximizing the total vitamin D intake while satisfying the constraints of vitamin C intake and juice box preferences. This will provide the scientist with an optimal juice drinking strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"VitaminDIntake\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of orange juice boxes\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of apple juice boxes\n\n# Set the objective function: Maximize total vitamin D intake\nmodel.setObjective(10 * x + 12 * y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(8 * x + 6 * y <= 300, name=\"VitaminCLimit\")  # Vitamin C intake limit\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 3 * x, name=\"JuicePreference\")  # Juice box preference\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 3, name=\"MinimumOrangeJuice\")  # Minimum orange juice box requirement\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized total vitamin D intake: {:.2f} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of orange juice boxes: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of apple juice boxes: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of orange and apple juice boxes to drink, respectively. We set the objective function to maximize the total vitamin D intake and add three constraints: the vitamin C intake limit, the juice box preference, and the minimum orange juice box requirement.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximized total vitamin D intake and the optimal number of orange and apple juice boxes.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the scientist's vitamin intake problem while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"VitaminDIntake\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x\")  # Number of orange juice boxes\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"y\")  # Number of apple juice boxes\n\n# Set the objective function: Maximize total vitamin D intake\nmodel.setObjective(10 * x + 12 * y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(8 * x + 6 * y <= 300, name=\"VitaminCLimit\")  # Vitamin C intake limit\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 3 * x, name=\"JuicePreference\")  # Juice box preference\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 3, name=\"MinimumOrangeJuice\")  # Minimum orange juice box requirement\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized total vitamin D intake: {:.2f} units\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of orange juice boxes: {:.2f}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of apple juice boxes: {:.2f}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide the milk tea shop owner with the most economically efficient production strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the milk tea shop owner:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the milk tea shop problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"MilkTeaShopOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of bottles of black milk tea\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of bottles of matcha milk tea\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(600*x + 525*y <= 30000, name=\"MilkConstraint\")  # Milk stock constraint\nmodel.addConstr(10*x + 5*y <= 500, name=\"HoneyConstraint\")  # Honey stock constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize profits\nmodel.setObjective(7.5*x + 5*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized profits: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of bottles of black milk tea: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of bottles of matcha milk tea: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"MilkTeaShopOptimization\" for the milk tea shop problem.\n3. Adds two decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the number of bottles of black milk tea and matcha milk tea to be made, respectively. These variables are defined as non-negative integers.\n4. Adds two constraints:\n   - Milk stock constraint: The total amount of milk used in the production of all milk teas must not exceed 30000 grams.\n   - Honey stock constraint: The total amount of honey used in the production of all milk teas must not exceed 500 grams.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize profits, which is 7.5*x + 5*y.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the maximized profits and the optimal number of bottles of each type of milk tea.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a concise method to solve the optimization problem for the milk tea shop owner using the `coptpy` library, considering both the constraints of milk and honey stock and the objective of maximizing profits.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the milk tea shop problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"MilkTeaShopOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of bottles of black milk tea\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of bottles of matcha milk tea\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(600*x + 525*y <= 30000, name=\"MilkConstraint\")  # Milk stock constraint\nmodel.addConstr(10*x + 5*y <= 500, name=\"HoneyConstraint\")  # Honey stock constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize profits\nmodel.setObjective(7.5*x + 5*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized profits: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of bottles of black milk tea: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of bottles of matcha milk tea: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of small buses hired.\n- \\(y\\): Number of large buses hired.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of buses: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Ensure that all students are transported:\n   - \\(20x + 50y \\geq 500\\)\n2. Parking lot capacity constraint, allowing a maximum of 20% of the buses to be large buses:\n   - \\(y \\leq 0.2(x + y)\\)\n   - This can be simplified to \\(y \\leq 0.2x + 0.2y\\), further simplified to \\(0.8y \\leq 0.2x\\), and finally \\(y \\leq 0.25x\\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y\\) must be integers, as the number of buses cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of small and large buses to hire, minimizing the total number of buses while satisfying the transportation needs of all students and the parking lot capacity constraint. This will provide the school with the most cost-effective bus hiring strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BusRentalOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of small buses\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of large buses\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of buses\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Ensure that all students are transported\nmodel.addConstr(20 * x + 50 * y >= 500, name=\"StudentTransportation\")\n\n# Parking lot capacity constraint, allowing a maximum of 20% of the buses to be large buses\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 0.25 * x, name=\"ParkingLotConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total number of buses: {}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of small buses: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of large buses: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add two integer decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of small and large buses, respectively.\n\nNext, we set the objective function to minimize the total number of buses, which is `x + y`.\n\nWe add two constraints:\n1. Ensure that all students are transported: `20 * x + 50 * y >= 500`\n2. Parking lot capacity constraint, allowing a maximum of 20% of the buses to be large buses: `y <= 0.25 * x`\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the minimum total number of buses and the number of each type of bus.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the school's bus hiring problem while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BusRentalOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of small buses\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of large buses\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of buses\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Ensure that all students are transported\nmodel.addConstr(20 * x + 50 * y >= 500, name=\"StudentTransportation\")\n\n# Parking lot capacity constraint, allowing a maximum of 20% of the buses to be large buses\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 0.25 * x, name=\"ParkingLotConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total number of buses: {}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of small buses: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of large buses: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide the cleaning company with the most effective advertising strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the cleaning company's advertising campaign:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the cleaning company's advertising campaign problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CleaningCompanyAdvertisingOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=15, ub=40, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of radio ads\ny = model.addVar(lb=35, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of social media ads\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(5000*x + 9150*y <= 250000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total exposure\nmodel.setObjective(60500*x + 50000*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total exposure: {model.objval} viewers\")\n    print(f\"Optimal ad quantities: Radio ads = {x.x}, Social media ads = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first import the `coptpy` library and create a COPT environment.\n\n2. Then, we create a COPT model for the cleaning company's advertising campaign problem.\n\n3. We add two decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the quantities of radio ads and social media ads to be run. The lower and upper bounds of `x` are set to 15 and 40, respectively, and the lower bound of `y` is set to 35. Both variables are defined as integer types.\n\n4. Next, we add a budget constraint to ensure that the total cost of the ads does not exceed $250,000.\n\n5. We set the objective function to maximize total exposure, which is calculated as 60500*x + 50000*y.\n\n6. Then, we call the `model.solve()` method to solve the model.\n\n7. Finally, we analyze the solution. If an optimal solution is found, we print the maximized total exposure and the optimal ad quantities. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no optimal solution was found.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the cleaning company's advertising campaign using the `coptpy` library, maximizing total exposure while satisfying the budget and ad quantity constraints.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the cleaning company's advertising campaign problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CleaningCompanyAdvertisingOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=15, ub=40, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of radio ads\ny = model.addVar(lb=35, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of social media ads\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(5000*x + 9150*y <= 250000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize total exposure\nmodel.setObjective(60500*x + 50000*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized total exposure: {model.objval} viewers\")\n    print(f\"Optimal ad quantities: Radio ads = {x.x}, Social media ads = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1\\): Number of commercials on Pi TV.\n- \\(x_2\\): Number of commercials on Beta Video.\n- \\(x_3\\): Number of commercials on Gamma Live.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize expected audience reach: \\(Z = 2000x_1 + 5000x_2 + 9000x_3\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Budget constraint: \\(1200x_1 + 2000x_2 + 4000x_3 \\leq 20000\\)\n2. Commercial limit on Beta Video: \\(x_2 \\leq 8\\)\n3. Commercial placement constraints on Gamma Live and Pi TV:\n   - \\(x_3 \\leq \\frac{1}{3}(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)\\)\n   - \\(x_1 \\geq 0.2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)\\)\n4. Non-negativity constraints:\n   - \\(x_1, x_2, x_3 \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) must be integers, as the number of commercials cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of commercials to run on each streaming platform, maximizing the expected audience reach while satisfying the budget constraint and the commercial placement constraints of the streaming platforms. This will provide the food company with an optimized commercial placement strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the food company's commercial placement problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"AdvertisementAllocation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of commercials on Pi TV\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of commercials on Beta Video\nx3 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x3\")  # Number of commercials on Gamma Live\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(2000*x1 + 5000*x2 + 9000*x3, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(1200*x1 + 2000*x2 + 4000*x3 <= 20000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x2 <= 8, name=\"BetaVideoConstraint\")  # Commercial limit on Beta Video\nmodel.addConstr(x3 <= (x1 + x2 + x3)/3, name=\"GammaLiveUpperConstraint\")  # Commercial placement upper limit on Gamma Live\nmodel.addConstr(x1 >= 0.2*(x1 + x2 + x3), name=\"PiTVLowerConstraint\")  # Commercial placement lower limit on Pi TV\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized expected audience reach: {:.0f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of commercials on Pi TV: {:.0f}\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of commercials on Beta Video: {:.0f}\".format(x2.x))\n    print(\"Number of commercials on Gamma Live: {:.0f}\".format(x3.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we define three decision variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, representing the number of commercials to be run on Pi TV, Beta Video, and Gamma Live, respectively.\n\nNext, we set the objective function, which is to maximize the expected audience reach. The objective function is the sum of the expected audience reach for each platform multiplied by the corresponding number of commercials.\n\nThen, we add four constraints:\n1. Budget constraint: The total cost of commercials should not exceed $20000.\n2. Commercial limit on Beta Video: The number of commercials on Beta Video should not exceed 8.\n3. Commercial placement upper limit on Gamma Live: The number of commercials on Gamma Live should not exceed a third of the total number of commercials.\n4. Commercial placement lower limit on Pi TV: The number of commercials on Pi TV should be at least 20% of the total number of commercials.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results. If an optimal solution is found, we print the maximized expected audience reach and the number of commercials on each platform. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no optimal solution was found.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the food company's commercial placement problem, considering all the given constraints and objectives.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"AdvertisementAllocation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of commercials on Pi TV\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of commercials on Beta Video\nx3 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x3\")  # Number of commercials on Gamma Live\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(2000*x1 + 5000*x2 + 9000*x3, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(1200*x1 + 2000*x2 + 4000*x3 <= 20000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x2 <= 8, name=\"BetaVideoConstraint\")  # Commercial limit on Beta Video\nmodel.addConstr(x3 <= (x1 + x2 + x3)/3, name=\"GammaLiveUpperConstraint\")  # Commercial placement upper limit on Gamma Live\nmodel.addConstr(x1 >= 0.2*(x1 + x2 + x3), name=\"PiTVLowerConstraint\")  # Commercial placement lower limit on Pi TV\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized expected audience reach: {:.0f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of commercials on Pi TV: {:.0f}\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of commercials on Beta Video: {:.0f}\".format(x2.x))\n    print(\"Number of commercials on Gamma Live: {:.0f}\".format(x3.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:58 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Then, we add two integer decision variables `x1` and `x2`, representing the number of pop and R&B concerts, respectively.\n\nNext, we set the objective function to minimize the total number of concerts, which is `x1 + x2`.\n\nThen, we add three constraints:\n1.

This will provide the airport with the most cost-effective transportation equipment installation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the airport transportation equipment optimization problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the airport transportation equipment problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"AirportTransportationEquipment\")\n\n# Add variables for the number of escalators and elevators\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of escalators\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of elevators\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 8*y >= 400, name=\"TransportationCapacityConstraint\")  # Transportation capacity constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 3*y, name=\"EquipmentRatioConstraint\")  # Equipment ratio constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 2, name=\"MinimumElevatorsConstraint\")  # Minimum number of elevators constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total units of space taken\nmodel.setObjective(5*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total units of space taken: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of escalators: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of elevators: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first creates a COPT environment and model. Then, it defines two integer decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of escalators and elevators to be installed.\n\nNext, the script adds three constraint conditions:\n1. Transportation capacity constraint: Ensures that the installed escalators and elevators can transport at least 400 people every minute.\n2. Equipment ratio constraint: Ensures that there are at least three times more escalators than elevators.\n3. Minimum number of elevators constraint: Ensures that at least 2 elevators are used.\n\nThe objective function is set to minimize the total units of space taken, which is `5*x + 2*y`.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the optimal solution (if found). It prints the minimum total units of space taken, as well as the optimal number of escalators and elevators.\n\nThis script provides a concise and effective way to solve the airport transportation equipment optimization problem using the `coptpy` library, considering all the given constraints and objectives.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the airport transportation equipment problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"AirportTransportationEquipment\")\n\n# Add variables for the number of escalators and elevators\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of escalators\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of elevators\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(20*x + 8*y >= 400, name=\"TransportationCapacityConstraint\")  # Transportation capacity constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 3*y, name=\"EquipmentRatioConstraint\")  # Equipment ratio constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 2, name=\"MinimumElevatorsConstraint\")  # Minimum number of elevators constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total units of space taken\nmodel.setObjective(5*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total units of space taken: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of escalators: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of elevators: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Next, we add two constraints: the gold usage constraint and the wire usage constraint.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of cheap boxes to make.\n- \\(y\\): The number of expensive boxes to make.\n\nThese variables represent the number of each type of box to make in order to maximize the amount of foam produced.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the amount of foam produced: \\(Z = 8x + 10y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total amount of foam produced based on the number of each type of box made and their respective contributions to the foam production.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Metal usage constraint: \\(3x + 5y \\leq 200\\)\n   - This ensures that the total amount of metal used in making the boxes does not exceed the available 200 units of metal.\n2. Acid usage constraint: \\(5x + 8y \\leq 300\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limitation on the usage of acid, ensuring that the total amount of acid used does not exceed the available 300 units of acid.\n3. Heat emission constraint: \\(2x + 3y \\leq 50\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limitation on the heat emission, ensuring that the total amount of heat given off does not exceed the maximum limit of 50 units of heat.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of boxes cannot be negative or fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of each type of box to make in order to maximize the amount of foam produced while satisfying the constraints of metal and acid usage and heat emission. This will provide the science store with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the science store:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the science store problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ScienceStoreOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of cheap boxes\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of expensive boxes\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y <= 200, name=\"MetalConstraint\")  # Metal usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 8*y <= 300, name=\"AcidConstraint\")  # Acid usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(2*x + 3*y <= 50, name=\"HeatConstraint\")  # Heat emission constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the amount of foam produced\nmodel.setObjective(8*x + 10*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized amount of foam: {model.objval} units\")\n    print(f\"Optimal box quantities: Cheap boxes = {x.x}, Expensive boxes = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"ScienceStoreOptimization\" for the science store problem.\n3. Adds two non-negative integer variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of cheap and expensive boxes to make, respectively.\n4. Adds three constraints:\n   - Metal usage constraint: `3*x + 5*y <= 200`\n   - Acid usage constraint: `5*x + 8*y <= 300`\n   - Heat emission constraint: `2*x + 3*y <= 50`\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize the amount of foam produced: `8*x + 10*y`.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, prints the maximized amount of foam and the optimal quantities of each type of box.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a concise method to solve the optimization problem for the science store using the `coptpy` library, considering all the given constraints and the objective function.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the science store problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ScienceStoreOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of cheap boxes\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of expensive boxes\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y <= 200, name=\"MetalConstraint\")  # Metal usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 8*y <= 300, name=\"AcidConstraint\")  # Acid usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(2*x + 3*y <= 50, name=\"HeatConstraint\")  # Heat emission constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the amount of foam produced\nmodel.setObjective(8*x + 10*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized amount of foam: {model.objval} units\")\n    print(f\"Optimal box quantities: Cheap boxes = {x.x}, Expensive boxes = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The following is the formulation of the model:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of plush toys to buy.\n- \\(y\\): The number of dolls to buy.\n\nThese variables represent the quantities of plush toys and dolls that the store owner plans to buy.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize profit: \\(Z = 4x + 2y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total profit based on the quantities of plush toys and dolls sold and their respective profits.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Inventory cost constraint: \\(3x + 2y \\leq 700\\)\n   - This ensures that the total cost of buying plush toys and dolls does not exceed the owner's budget.\n2. Plush toy sales quantity constraint: \\(90 \\leq x \\leq 190\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of plush toys sold is between 90 and 190.\n3. Doll sales quantity constraint: \\(y \\leq 2x\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of dolls sold does not exceed twice the number of plush toys sold.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the quantities of toys cannot be negative or fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal quantities of plush toys and dolls to buy and sell, maximizing profit while satisfying the inventory cost and sales quantity constraints. This will provide the toy store owner with the most economically efficient purchasing and sales strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the toy store:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the toy store problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ToyStoreOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Plush toys\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Dolls\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 2*y <= 700, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Inventory cost constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 90, name=\"MinPlushConstraint\")  # Minimum plush toy sales quantity\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 190, name=\"MaxPlushConstraint\")  # Maximum plush toy sales quantity\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 2*x, name=\"DollConstraint\")  # Doll sales quantity constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize profit\nmodel.setObjective(4*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal quantities: Plush toys = {x.x}, Dolls = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"ToyStoreOptimization\" for the toy store problem.\n3. Adds two integer decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the quantities of plush toys and dolls to buy.\n4. Adds four constraint conditions:\n   - Inventory cost constraint: The total cost of buying plush toys and dolls does not exceed $700.\n   - Minimum plush toy sales quantity: The number of plush toys sold is at least 90.\n   - Maximum plush toy sales quantity: The number of plush toys sold is at most 190.\n   - Doll sales quantity constraint: The number of dolls sold does not exceed twice the number of plush toys sold.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize profit, which is 4x + 2y.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the maximized profit and the optimal quantities of plush toys and dolls.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for the toy store using the `coptpy` library, maximizing profit while satisfying the inventory cost and sales quantity constraints.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the toy store problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"ToyStoreOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Plush toys\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Dolls\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 2*y <= 700, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Inventory cost constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x >= 90, name=\"MinPlushConstraint\")  # Minimum plush toy sales quantity\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 190, name=\"MaxPlushConstraint\")  # Maximum plush toy sales quantity\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 2*x, name=\"DollConstraint\")  # Doll sales quantity constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize profit\nmodel.setObjective(4*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal quantities: Plush toys = {x.x}, Dolls = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Transportation demand constraint: `100 * x1 + 80 * x2 >= 1000`, ensuring that the transportation demand is met.\n2. Submarine trip limit: `x1 <= 6`, limiting the number of submarine trips to a maximum of 6.\n3. Boat trip limit: `x2 >= 0.5 * (x1 + x2)`, ensuring that at least 50% of the trips are by boat.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the minimum total amount of gas used and the number of submarine and boat trips.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the mail transportation problem in the tropical city, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"MailTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of submarine trips\nx2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of boat trips\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total amount of gas used\nmodel.setObjective(30 * x1 + 25 * x2, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(100 * x1 + 80 * x2 >= 1000, name=\"TransportationDemand\")\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 6, name=\"SubmarineLimit\")\nmodel.addConstr(x2 >= 0.5 * (x1 + x2), name=\"BoatLimit\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total amount of gas used: {:.2f} liters\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of submarine trips: {:.0f}\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Number of boat trips: {:.0f}\".format(x2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

This will provide the fire department with the most cost-effective strategy for allocating its fire fighter resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the fire department:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the fire department problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"FireDepartmentOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of regular fire fighters\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of emergency fire fighters\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10*x + 6*y >= 300, name=\"WorkHourRequirement\")  # Meet the fire fighter time demand\nmodel.addConstr(300*x + 100*y <= 7000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of fire fighters\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of fire fighters: {round(model.objval)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of regular fire fighters: {round(x.x)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of emergency fire fighters: {round(y.x)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the necessary `coptpy` library and `COPT` constants.\n2. Creates a `COPT` environment and model.\n3. Adds two decision variables, `x` and `y`, representing the number of regular and emergency fire fighters, respectively. These variables are defined as non-negative integers.\n4. Adds two constraints:\n   - The first constraint ensures that the total number of hired fire fighters meets or exceeds the demand for 300 hours of fire fighter time.\n   - The second constraint reflects the budget limit of $7000 for the fire department.\n5. Sets the objective function to minimize the total number of fire fighters, which is `x + y`.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the minimum total number of fire fighters and the optimal number of regular and emergency fire fighters.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a concise method to solve the optimization problem for the fire department using the `coptpy` library, considering both the fire fighter time demand and the budget constraint.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the fire department problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"FireDepartmentOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of regular fire fighters\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of emergency fire fighters\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10*x + 6*y >= 300, name=\"WorkHourRequirement\")  # Meet the fire fighter time demand\nmodel.addConstr(300*x + 100*y <= 7000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of fire fighters\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of fire fighters: {round(model.objval)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of regular fire fighters: {round(x.x)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of emergency fire fighters: {round(y.x)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of bowls of salmon to eat.\n- \\(y\\): Number of bowls of eggs to eat.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total sodium intake: \\(Z = 80x + 20y\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Calorie requirement: \\(300x + 200y \\geq 2000\\)\n2. Protein requirement: \\(15x + 8y \\geq 90\\)\n3. Egg limit: \\(y \\leq 0.4(x + y)\\)\n4. Non-negativity constraint: \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x, y\\) must be integers, as the number of bowls cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of bowls of salmon and eggs to eat, minimizing sodium intake while satisfying the calorie and protein requirements. This will provide the fitness guru with a balanced and healthy diet plan.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the diet problem for the macro-counting fitness guru:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the macro-counting fitness guru's diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"MacroCountingDiet\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"SalmonBowl\")\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"EggBowl\")\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(300*x + 200*y >= 2000, name=\"CalorieRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(15*x + 8*y >= 90, name=\"ProteinRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 0.4*(x + y), name=\"EggLimit\")\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total sodium intake\nmodel.setObjective(80*x + 20*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total sodium intake: {} mg\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of bowls of salmon to eat: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of bowls of eggs to eat: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we add two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of bowls of salmon and eggs to eat, respectively.\n\nNext, we add three constraints:\n1. Calorie requirement: The sum of the calories from salmon and eggs must be greater than or equal to 2000 calories.\n2. Protein requirement: The sum of the protein from salmon and eggs must be greater than or equal to 90 grams.\n3. Egg limit: The number of bowls of eggs cannot exceed 40% of the total number of bowls of salmon and eggs.\n\nThen, we set the objective function to minimize the total sodium intake, which is the sum of the sodium from salmon and eggs.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and analyze the solution. If an optimal solution is found, we output the minimum total sodium intake and the optimal number of bowls of salmon and eggs to eat. If no optimal solution is found, we output the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the diet problem for a macro-counting fitness guru, helping him find a balanced and healthy diet plan.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the macro-counting fitness guru's diet problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"MacroCountingDiet\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"SalmonBowl\")\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"EggBowl\")\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(300*x + 200*y >= 2000, name=\"CalorieRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(15*x + 8*y >= 90, name=\"ProteinRequirement\")\nmodel.addConstr(y <= 0.4*(x + y), name=\"EggLimit\")\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total sodium intake\nmodel.setObjective(80*x + 20*y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total sodium intake: {} mg\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of bowls of salmon to eat: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of bowls of eggs to eat: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Area of land using heap leaching technique (in square miles).\n- \\(y\\): Area of land using vat leaching technique (in square miles).\n\nThese variables represent the areas of land using each mining technique.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the daily production of rare earth oxide: \\(Z = 3x + 5y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total daily production based on the areas of land using each mining technique and their respective production rates.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Machine usage constraint: \\(10x + 20y \\leq 100\\)\n   - This ensures that the total number of extraction machines used does not exceed the available 100 machines.\n2. Environmental regulation constraint: \\(8x + 17y \\leq 90\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limitation on the amount of polluted wastewater due to environmental regulations.\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\), as the areas of land cannot be negative.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal areas of land using each mining technique to maximize the daily production of rare earth oxide while satisfying the constraints of machine usage and environmental regulations. This will provide the mining company with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its mining resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the mining company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the mining company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"MiningCompanyOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x\")  # Area of land using heap leaching technique (in square miles)\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"y\")  # Area of land using vat leaching technique (in square miles)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10*x + 20*y <= 100, name=\"EquipmentConstraint\")  # Machine usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(8*x + 17*y <= 90, name=\"EnvironmentalConstraint\")  # Environmental regulation constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the daily production of rare earth oxide\nmodel.setObjective(3*x + 5*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized daily production of rare earth oxide: {model.objval} tons\")\n    print(f\"Area of land using heap leaching technique: {x.x} square miles\")\n    print(f\"Area of land using vat leaching technique: {y.x} square miles\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"MiningCompanyOptimization\" for the mining company problem.\n3. Adds two non-negative decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the areas of land using heap leaching and vat leaching techniques, respectively (in square miles).\n4. Adds two constraints:\n   - Machine usage constraint: The total number of extraction machines used does not exceed 100.\n   - Environmental regulation constraint: The amount of polluted wastewater does not exceed 90 tons daily.\n5. Sets the objective function to maximize the daily production of rare earth oxide.\n6. Solves the model.\n7.

Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of full-time staff hired.\n- \\(y\\): Number of part-time staff hired.\n\nThese variables represent the number of full-time and part-time staff hired by the municipality.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of staff: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of staff based on the number of full-time and part-time staff hired.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Labor demand constraint: \\(15y + 40x \\geq 1000\\)\n   - This ensures that the total labor hours provided by the hired staff meet or exceed the demand of 1000 hours.\n2. Budget constraint: \\(450y + 1280x \\leq 31500\\)\n   - This constraint ensures that the total cost of hiring staff does not exceed the budget of 31500 dollars.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of staff cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of full-time and part-time staff to hire, minimizing the total number of staff while satisfying the labor demand and budget constraints. This will provide the municipality with an economically efficient strategy for hiring mail delivery staff.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem of mail delivery staff for the municipality:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the city's mail delivery staff problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CityMailDeliveryStaffOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables for full-time and part-time staff\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of full-time staff\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of part-time staff\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(15*y + 40*x >= 1000, name=\"WorkloadConstraint\")  # Labor demand constraint\nmodel.addConstr(450*y + 1280*x <= 31500, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of staff\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of staff: {round(model.objval)}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal hiring plan: Full-time staff = {x.x}, Part-time staff = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"CityMailDeliveryStaffOptimization\" for the municipality's mail delivery staff problem.\n3. Adds two non-negative integer variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of full-time and part-time staff hired.\n4. Adds two constraints:\n   - Labor demand constraint: Ensures that the total labor hours provided by the hired staff meet or exceed the demand of 1000 hours.\n   - Budget constraint: Ensures that the total cost of hiring staff does not exceed the budget of 31500 dollars.\n5. Sets the objective function to minimize the total number of staff, which is `x + y`.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the minimum total number of staff and the optimal hiring plan (number of full-time and part-time staff).\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem of mail delivery staff for the municipality using the `coptpy` library, minimizing the total number of staff while satisfying the labor demand and budget constraints.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the city's mail delivery staff problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CityMailDeliveryStaffOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables for full-time and part-time staff\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of full-time staff\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of part-time staff\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(15*y + 40*x >= 1000, name=\"WorkloadConstraint\")  # Labor demand constraint\nmodel.addConstr(450*y + 1280*x <= 31500, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of staff\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of staff: {round(model.objval)}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal hiring plan: Full-time staff = {x.x}, Part-time staff = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): The number of dine-in places to open.\n- \\(y\\): The number of food-trucks to open.\n\nThese variables represent the number of each type of store to open in order to meet the daily sandwich production requirement.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of stores: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n  - This function calculates the total number of stores based on the number of each type of store opened.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Daily sandwich production requirement of at least 500: \\(100x + 50y \\geq 500\\)\n   - This ensures that the total number of stores opened meets or exceeds the daily production requirement of 500 sandwiches.\n2. Employee availability constraint of 35: \\(8x + 3y \\leq 35\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the limitation on the number of stores that can be opened due to the availability of only 35 employees.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of stores cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal number of each type of store to open in order to minimize the total number of stores while meeting the daily sandwich production requirement and adhering to the employee availability constraint. This will provide the sandwich company with the most cost-effective strategy to allocate its resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the sandwich company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the sandwich company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SandwichCompanyOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Dine-in places\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Food-trucks\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(100*x + 50*y >= 500, name=\"DemandConstraint\")  # Daily sandwich production requirement\nmodel.addConstr(8*x + 3*y <= 35, name=\"StaffConstraint\")  # Employee availability constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of stores\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of stores: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal store quantities: Dine-in places = {x.x}, Food-trucks = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Imports the `coptpy` library and creates a `COPT` environment.\n2. Creates a `COPT` model named \"SandwichCompanyOptimization\" for the sandwich company problem.\n3. Adds two non-negative integer variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of dine-in places and food-trucks to open, respectively.\n4. Adds two constraints:\n   - The \"DemandConstraint\" ensures that the total number of stores opened meets or exceeds the daily production requirement of 500 sandwiches.\n   - The \"StaffConstraint\" reflects the limitation on the number of stores that can be opened due to the availability of only 35 employees.\n5. Sets the objective function to minimize the total number of stores, which is `x + y`.\n6. Solves the model.\n7. Analyzes the solution:\n   - If an optimal solution is found, it prints the minimum total number of stores and the optimal quantities of each type of store.\n   - If no optimal solution is found, it prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a concise method to solve the optimization problem for the sandwich company using the `coptpy` library, considering both the daily sandwich production requirement and the employee availability constraint.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the sandwich company problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SandwichCompanyOptimization\")\n\n# Add variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Dine-in places\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Food-trucks\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(100*x + 50*y >= 500, name=\"DemandConstraint\")  # Daily sandwich production requirement\nmodel.addConstr(8*x + 3*y <= 35, name=\"StaffConstraint\")  # Employee availability constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize the total number of stores\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total number of stores: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal store quantities: Dine-in places = {x.x}, Food-trucks = {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Non-negativity constraint: \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n   - This ensures that the number of batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams prepared is non-negative.\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x, y\\) must be integers, as the number of batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams to prepare, maximizing the number of people treated while satisfying the constraints of preparation time, material usage, and the ratio of medication patches to anti-biotic creams. This will provide the hospital with an efficient medication preparation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the hospital's medication preparation problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the hospital medication preparation problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"HospitalMedicationPreparation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of batches of medication patches\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of batches of anti-biotic creams\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y <= 400, name=\"PreparationTimeConstraint\")  # Preparation time constraint\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 6*y <= 530, name=\"MaterialUsageConstraint\")  # Material usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 2*x, name=\"RatioConstraint\")  # Ratio constraint between medication patches and anti-biotic creams\nmodel.addConstr(x + y <= 100, name=\"StorageConstraint\")  # Storage constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the number of people treated\nmodel.setObjective(3*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized number of people treated: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of batches of medication patches: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of batches of anti-biotic creams: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first creates a COPT environment and model. Then, it defines two decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams to prepare, respectively.\n\nNext, the script adds four constraint conditions:\n1. Preparation time constraint: The total preparation time for medication patches and anti-biotic creams does not exceed 400 minutes.\n2. Material usage constraint: The total material usage for medication patches and anti-biotic creams does not exceed 530 units.\n3. Ratio constraint between medication patches and anti-biotic creams: There must be at least twice as many batches of anti-biotic creams as medication patches.\n4. Storage constraint: The total number of batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams does not exceed 100.\n\nThe objective function is set to maximize the number of people treated, i.e., `3*x + 2*y`.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the optimal solution (if found). It prints the maximized number of people treated and the optimal number of batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the hospital's medication preparation problem, considering all the given constraints and objectives.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for the hospital medication preparation problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"HospitalMedicationPreparation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of batches of medication patches\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of batches of anti-biotic creams\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(3*x + 5*y <= 400, name=\"PreparationTimeConstraint\")  # Preparation time constraint\nmodel.addConstr(5*x + 6*y <= 530, name=\"MaterialUsageConstraint\")  # Material usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(y >= 2*x, name=\"RatioConstraint\")  # Ratio constraint between medication patches and anti-biotic creams\nmodel.addConstr(x + y <= 100, name=\"StorageConstraint\")  # Storage constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize the number of people treated\nmodel.setObjective(3*x + 2*y, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized number of people treated: {model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of batches of medication patches: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Optimal number of batches of anti-biotic creams: {y.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

How many trips of each should be done to minimize the total number of trips?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the transportation problem for the industrial tire company, we need to construct a linear programming model to minimize the total number of trips while satisfying the tire demand, budget constraint, and the constraint on the number of plane trips. Here is the model formulation:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of plane trips.\n- \\(y\\): Number of ultrawide truck trips.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total number of trips: \\(Z = x + y\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Tire demand constraint: \\(10x + 6y \\geq 200\\)\n2. Budget constraint: \\(1000x + 700y \\leq 22000\\)\n3. Constraint on the number of plane trips: \\(x \\leq y\\)\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x, y \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of plane and ultrawide truck trips that minimize the total number of trips while satisfying the tire demand, budget constraint, and the constraint on the number of plane trips. This will provide the company with an economically efficient transportation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TireTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of plane trips\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of ultrawide truck trips\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of trips\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10 * x + 6 * y >= 200, name=\"DemandConstraint\")  # Tire demand constraint\nmodel.addConstr(1000 * x + 700 * y <= 22000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x <= y, name=\"PlaneConstraint\")  # Constraint on the number of plane trips\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total number of trips: {}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of plane trips: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of ultrawide truck trips: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add decision variables `x` and `y`, representing the number of plane and ultrawide truck trips, respectively. The objective function is to minimize the total number of trips, which is `x + y`.\n\nWe add three constraints:\n1. Tire demand constraint: `10 * x + 6 * y >= 200`, ensuring that the total number of transported tires meets the demand.\n2. Budget constraint: `1000 * x + 700 * y <= 22000`, ensuring that the total cost does not exceed the budget.\n3. Constraint on the number of plane trips: `x <= y`, ensuring that the number of plane trips does not exceed the number of ultrawide truck trips.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the minimum total number of trips and the number of plane and ultrawide truck trips.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the transportation problem for the industrial tire company, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "to_run_script": "\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TireTransportation\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of plane trips\ny = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of ultrawide truck trips\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the total number of trips\nmodel.setObjective(x + y, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10 * x + 6 * y >= 200, name=\"DemandConstraint\")  # Tire demand constraint\nmodel.addConstr(1000 * x + 700 * y <= 22000, name=\"BudgetConstraint\")  # Budget constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x <= y, name=\"PlaneConstraint\")  # Constraint on the number of plane trips\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total number of trips: {}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of plane trips: {}\".format(x.x))\n    print(\"Number of ultrawide truck trips: {}\".format(y.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Just print the best solution: {model.objval}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Best Solution\")", "execution_result": "2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.1.2 20240411\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/ORLM\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /mntcephfs/lab_data/tangzhengyang/conda/ReProver/bin\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/tangzhengyang/copt\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2024-05-11 12:20:59 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.
